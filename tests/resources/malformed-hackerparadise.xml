      <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;calling-gelato-lovers-everywhere&quot;&gt;Calling gelato lovers everywhere…&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pack-your-bagswere-heading-to-palermo-italy&quot;&gt;Pack your bags—we’re heading to Palermo, Italy!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bay&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island of Sicily is well-known for its delicious food, fantastic beach weather, and rich history. We’ll be spending 12 weeks there so you have enough time to learn why Palermo was just selected as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.italy24.ilsole24ore.com/art/arts-and-leisure/2017-01-31/palermo-wins-title-of-italian-capital-of-culture-2018-132401.php?uuid=AEXMZHL&quot;&gt;Italian Capital of Culture for 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If nothing else, watch this video:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ecpwfqBZMM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While you can circle the island in a day, there are countless places to visit, foods to eat, people to meet, and things to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org/apply&quot;&gt;Apply here&lt;/a&gt; before spots run out. This is not a trip you will want to miss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;palermo-italy-june-4--august-26&quot;&gt;Palermo, Italy (June 4 – August 26)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mount Etna&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the heart of the Mediterranean, Sicily is a bustling island made up of miles of coastline, picturesque mountains, and Mount Etna—the tallest active volcano in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p03.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Beach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, sunshine! We will be in Palermo during the driest and sunniest part of the year. With the ocean water between 21-26 C (70-79 F) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.traveltipy.com/best-beaches-in-sicily-the-most-beautiful-sicilian-beaches/&quot;&gt;one of the best beaches&lt;/a&gt; only 20 minutes away, you will have a hard time staying out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your pick between beautiful sandy beaches and rugged fishing villages. Eat fresh seafood while you watch the sunset. Your Instagram will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p04.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Brioche col gelato&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, mom—in Sicily it’s totally appropriate to have an ice cream sandwich or ‘brioche col gelato’ for breakfast. You’ll wonder how you ever lived without it all these years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p05.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Pizza&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannoli, arancini, seafood pasta, and savory pizza. There are &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many good foods to list. I’m going to leave this gem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/serenas44360bc8c/23-sicilian-dishes-to-die-for-12cks?utm_term=.jyDXBVRWy#.vj2qwRMk2&quot;&gt;23 Sicilian Dishes To Die For&lt;/a&gt; here for you. Insider tip: don’t read it on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a tasty bite on the go? Forbes listed Palermo as one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehlk45fiii/5-palermo-italy-3/#43c94e4a3a75&quot;&gt;The World’s Top 10 Cities for Street Food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p06.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Wine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wine—need I say more? Over the summer, you’ll share countless bottles of wine while learning to enjoy the Italian pace of life. Goodbye, stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p07.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ruins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in seeing ancient ruins? Look no further. Sicily has some of the best-preserved Greek and Roman ruins not only in all of Italy—but in all of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p08.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Market&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit up the outdoor markets during the day to barter for spices, fresh seafood, or local handcrafts. Come back after sunset to meet up with Sicilians drinking 1€ wine, eating tasty street food, and enjoying the vibrant night life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p09a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Palermo cathedral&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p09b.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Church&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Western. Wait, that’s Islamic. No, that looks more like Byzantine architecture. Welcome to the unique style of Sicilian architecture that incorporates elements from all of the different cultures that have occupied the island at some point in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p10.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Festival&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join in the celebration during Palermo’s biggest festival of the year. During the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitsicily.info/en/the-feast-of-santa-rosalia/&quot;&gt;Feast of Santa Rosalia&lt;/a&gt;, Palermo’s streets are alive with music, shows, dancing, fireworks, and a parade led by a ten-meter tall vessel-shaped chariot pulled by oxen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p11.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Teatro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch an opera or ballet at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teatromassimo.it/&quot;&gt;Teatro Massimo&lt;/a&gt;, the first opera house in Italy and the third largest opera house in Europe, or catch the Sicilian symphony orchestra at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orchestrasinfonicasiciliana.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=frontpage&amp;amp;Itemid=1&amp;amp;lang=en&quot;&gt;Teatro Politeama Garibaldi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p12.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Mansion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse.” Fans of The Godfather can go visit the hometown of the Corleone family and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ate_Gy36Vyk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;see locations&lt;/a&gt; where the trilogy was filmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p13.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Coastline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a break from all this culture? The rugged nature of Sicily provides plenty of opportunities to get your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sicily4u.co.uk/blog/travel/top-5-activities-for-adrenaline-junkies-in-sicily/&quot;&gt;adrenaline fix&lt;/a&gt; while rafting, rock climbing, mountain biking, cliff diving, hiking volcanoes or driving—the ultimate Italian adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fancy a weekend on Ibiza, the Croatian coast, or some idyllic Greek islands? Maybe you’d rather experience Rome or live it up in Amsterdam, Madrid, or Paris. They are all a quick flight away and you can find roundtrip tickets for under 200€.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/palermo-2017/p15.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flight map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pricing&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirm for our Palermo trip by March 8 and you’ll receive special early-bird pricing ($100 off your trip).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing our Open Source Fellowship</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/11/17/open-source-fellowship</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/11/17/open-source-fellowship</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to spend a month in South America, expenses paid, working on Open Source?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that we’re partnering with &lt;a href=&quot;https://changelog.com/&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/a&gt; to offer two Open Source Fellowships for our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/11/01/south-america-housing-coworking/&quot;&gt;upcoming trip to South America&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/os-fellowship/combo_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hacker Paradise Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hacker Paradise, we’re big fans of the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we launched our very first trip back in 2014, a lot of the people crazy enough to join us came from the open source world. Now that we’re a bit more mature as an organization, we want to give back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Source Fellowships will cover a month of accommodations, workspace, our events, and a stipend for living expenses for you to join our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/11/01/south-america-housing-coworking/&quot;&gt;South America trip&lt;/a&gt; and work full-time on an open source project of your choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://changelog.com/&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/a&gt; will be following along and will be producing a few podcasts to help tell the OSS story for those who get selected for this fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this will give you an excuse to take some time off from work and focus full-time on an open source project that you care about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/os-fellowship/rooftop_coworking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coworking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-we-looking-for&quot;&gt;What are we looking for?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly, we’d like to maximize the impact these fellowships can have on the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, we’re looking for maintainers or contributors to popular projects who have 1-2 major ideas they’ve been meaning to implement, but haven’t had the time to do so outside of work. We’re also open to people who are less engaged in open source, but who would like to dive in more fully and spend a month working exclusively on a new or existing project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing we’ll be looking at is the scope of the project. We want to make sure it’s something that one could feasibly finish or make significant progress on in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re looking for people who are willing and able to focus on open source full-time for a month and who wouldn’t be able to otherwise do so. If your company pays you to work on open source, or if you’d like to freelance part-time while traveling with us, please apply as a normal participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and of course, we’re looking for people who are looking for an adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/os-fellowship/waterfall_hike.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfall hike in Thailand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logistics&quot;&gt;Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recipients of the Open Source Fellowship will have the option of joining us for a month on one of our upcoming trips to Buenos Aires, Argentina (Jan 8 - March 4, 2017) or Lima, Peru (March 12 - May 6, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fellowship includes accommodations (private bedroom), workspace, and our program fee for one month ($1,980 total), as well as a $750 stipend for food and basic living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recipients of the fellowship are responsible for getting to / from the destination, and for any travel, food, and entertainment expenses in excess of the stipend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re planning to give away two fellowships, although the final number could go up or down depending on applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-apply&quot;&gt;How do I apply?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerparadise.typeform.com/to/eRSzCt&quot;&gt;apply here&lt;/a&gt; for the fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve applied, we’ll review your application. If we think you might be a good fit, we’ll schedule an interview to get to know you a bit better and to find out more about your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will accept applications until December 21, 2016. We’ll be interviewing applicants on a rolling basis, so we recommend applying sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see how this program develops! If your company would be interested in sponsoring an Open Source Fellowship for future trips, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:casey@hackerparadise.org&quot;&gt;send us an email&lt;/a&gt; and we can pass along information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(also, we want to give a hat-tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat&quot;&gt;Open Source Retreat&lt;/a&gt; as the inspiration for this idea)&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/11/01/south-america-housing-coworking</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a sneak peek of the places we’ll be living and working for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/10/07/heading-to-south-america/&quot;&gt;our South America trip&lt;/a&gt; starting in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heads-upthings-are-about-to-get-really-really-posh&quot;&gt;Heads up—things are about to get really, really posh.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/main.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-to-know-the-neighborhood-palermo-soho-buenos-aires&quot;&gt;Getting to know the neighborhood: Palermo Soho, Buenos Aires&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be staying in the heart of Palermo Soho, the hippest and most happening part of town (often compared to Brooklyn, New York). The tree-lined cobblestone streets are full of cafés, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, parks, museums, galleries, shops and artisanal markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Palermo1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Palermo2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Palermo3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;housing---buenos-aires&quot;&gt;Housing - Buenos Aires&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to live in style? We’ll be staying in a luxury apartment complex throughout our time in Buenos Aires:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_outside.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_lobby.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re talking floor-to-ceiling windows, king-sized beds, fully equipped kitchens, and plush couches. This is the way to travel in style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_kitchen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_bathroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_living.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_bedroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and each room has its own private balcony with a killer view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_view.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to luxury apartments, the building has a beautiful rooftop terrace, where we’ll be hosting wine tastings and Argentinian BBQs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Byblos_events.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have serious FOMO yet, wait until you see the coworking space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coworking---buenos-aires&quot;&gt;Coworking - Buenos Aires&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re partnering up with the biggest coworking space in South America, &lt;a href=&quot;http://areatresworkplace.com/&quot;&gt;Areatres&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve just opened a new 5-floor, state-of-the-art facility a short walk away from our housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Areatres_main_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Areatres_main_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the main areas, we’ll have our own private suite in the building with 24-hour access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Areatres_suite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areatres sponsors big events like Creative Mornings, TEDx conferences, and networking events with the tech, design, and entrepreneur scene in Buenos Aires. They even hold daily stretching sessions in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Areatres_tedx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Areatres_stretching.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And did we mention Argentinian BBQ networking events here as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/BA/Areatres_bbq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-housing/Lima/lima_main.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lima&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-to-know-the-neighborhood---miraflores-lima&quot;&gt;Getting to know the neighborhood - Miraflores, Lima&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be nestled in the Miraflores neighborhood—a district built on both traditional and trendy influences. We are surrounded by of some of the best restaurants in Lima and a quick walk from the Malecón, a park that stretches 10-kilometers along the coast where locals gather to unwind and enjoy the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be living in luxury apartments again in Lima!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a gym, sauna, and party room with a pool table and a grill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, though, we also have a rooftop infinity pool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working a short walk away at &lt;a href=&quot;http://residencia.pe/&quot;&gt;Residencia&lt;/a&gt;, the premier coworking space in Lima.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updated FAQ</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/10/12/updated-faq</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/10/12/updated-faq</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People ask a lot of the same questions in interviews, so we decided to put together a list of the most common ones and write an update to our FAQ! Read on below for answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#kinds_of_people&quot;&gt;What kinds of people come to Hacker Paradise?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how_big&quot;&gt;How big are the groups?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#look_for&quot;&gt;What do you look for in applicants?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#not_a_programmer&quot;&gt;I’m not a programmer / designer / entrepreneur. Can I come?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#different_than&quot;&gt;How is Hacker Paradise different than &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;__?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#typical_day&quot;&gt;What’s a typical day like?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#where_next&quot;&gt;Where are you going next and when are you announcing it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what_included&quot;&gt;What is included in the price?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#transportation&quot;&gt;What will I do for transportation?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namekindsofpeopleawhat-kinds-of-people-come-to-hacker-paradise&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;kinds_of_people&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What kinds of people come to Hacker Paradise?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the people who come on our trips can be split into 3 buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freelancers – people who work remotely for 1 or more clients on a contract basis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remote workers - people who have 1 company that they work for full-time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurs - people who are running their company remotely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People on sabbatical – people who have decided to take some time off between switching jobs or take an extended vacation to work on their own personal projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of profession, the majority of people who come on our trips are developers, designers, or entrepreneurs. We also take other creative types, like writers, architects, project managers, photographers, etc., as long as they’re comfortable in a community with a focus on tech &amp;amp; startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the people on our trips are from the U.S.A, Canada, or Europe, but we also get people from all over the world, including places like Chile, Ecuador, India, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and Lebanon. Our alumni community hails from 35+ countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of our participants are in their 20s and 30s, but we’ve had people on our trip ranging from 18 to 60 years old. We’ve even had a few families come with children as young as 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t care about where you’re from or your age as long as you are a creative professional that we feel is a good fit for the community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namehowbigahow-big-are-your-trips&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;how_big&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How big are your trips?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups are typically 30-35 people, but they are sometimes a bit bigger or smaller. We tend to not get too much bigger than this, as we’ve noticed in the past that the group dynamic changes once we get higher than 35-40 people. With 30-40 people, there is enough diversity within the group to find people who are interested in the same things as you, but the group is small enough that you still know everyone and the community doesn’t splinter off into different cliques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namelookforawhat-do-you-look-for-in-applicants&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;look_for&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What do you look for in applicants?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we look for in prospective applicants is some kind of generative, creative skillset, like programming, design, writing, etc. We want everyone who comes to be able to create something while with us and potentially collaborate with others on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, we also look for a history of creating things, particularly passion projects. Similarly, we also look for applicants to have a specific project that they want to work on during the trip. As we’re relatively unstructured (we don’t have a curriculum and won’t be telling you how to spend your time), it’s important for you to know what you want to work on and to have the skills to work on it in a self-directed way. This could be a full-time job, learning a new skill, or a side project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also look for people who have unique backgrounds and life experiences to share with the group. For example, tell us in your application if you led the linguistics community in compiling a dictionary for the Na’vi language, learned to code while supporting yourself by playing poker professionally, picked up Japanese by living in a monastery in Japan for 6 months, or spent several years working as a statistician in a hedge fund focusing on horse gambling. These are all examples of actual people who have come on our trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namenotaprogrammeraim-not-a-programmer--designer--entrepreneur-can-i-come&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;not_a_programmer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’m not a programmer / designer / entrepreneur. Can I come?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a creative type that doesn’t work in tech (writer, architect, artist, etc.), that’s awesome! We love having other types of people on the trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your application, tell us about your projects and why they are interesting (what are you doing that’s new and innovative?). Also, let us know that you’re comfortable hanging out with techies in a tech-focused community, as the majority of our professional talks are on topics like programming, design, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re non-technical and your main role isn’t generative (marketer, sales, project management), tell us in your application about things you’ve created or interesting life experiences you’ve had. This could be starting a company, building a blog, becoming a professional poker player, motorcycling through South America, or something else entirely. Also, tell us why you’re interested in being part of a tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few types of people who we don’t typically accept:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Life coaches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop shippers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affiliate marketers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People from these backgrounds have historically not been a good cultural fit for our community. However, we do keep an open mind, and make decisions on a person-by-person basis. If you do fall into one of the above categories, try and make sure your application is extremely strong in another area, by showing us a strong history of working on creative side projects outside of work or having some really interesting life experience (i.e., talk about how you’re writing a novel or how you spent several years living in Zimbabwe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namedifferentthanahow-is-hacker-paradise-different-than-&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;different_than&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How is Hacker Paradise different than &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;___?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve run trips to over 10 countries over the past  2 years, so we’ve worked out a lot of the kinks and have been working continuously to improve the participant experience (we still adapt and try new things each trip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that time, we’ve had 300+ people come on our trips, so we now have alumni in 35+ countries around the world. Wherever you go after the program, there’s likely either someone else traveling there or an alumni living there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the thing that I think is hard to understand until you’ve been on one of our trips is that Hacker Paradise ends up being an accelerator for personal and professional growth.
More so than just arranging logistics to make it easier to work and travel, we actively screen for people who are working on creative and entrepreneurial projects, people who we think will add value to a creative professional community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an incredibly supportive, stimulating environment, and people will often leave the trip with new projects, ideas, and sometimes jobs or career directions. It’s also common for people to go on to hire each other or collaborate in other ways, even after the trip ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nametypicaldayawhats-a-typical-day--week-like&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;typical_day&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What’s a typical day / week like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hacker Paradise program is built around a number of keystone events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monday-lunch&quot;&gt;Monday lunch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a social event where everyone on the trip gets together to hang out and chat about what they’re working for the week. Food is on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tuesday-talks--events&quot;&gt;Tuesday talks / events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesdays, we’ll typically organize some kind of professional event. This will usually be a series of talks given by people within the group, but we’ll also often organize events with the local tech scene. Talks are split about 50-50 between tech-related topics (i.e. intro to Meteor, writing about yourself and your product, bootstrapping abroad) and non-tech-related topics (mindfulness, the neurobiology of sleep, ethical tourism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thursday-demos--reciprocity-ring&quot;&gt;Thursday Demos / Reciprocity Ring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week on Thursdays, we alternate between two events. The first is group demos, where people can show what they’ve been working on and get feedback from the group. Demos also serve as a time to set goals and talk about ways to support each other through accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is the Reciprocity Ring, which is an exercise where everyone in the group goes around and asks for at least 1 thing they could use help with from the group, personally or professionally. This exercise helps build a culture of giving within the community, and also helps people realize when there are others with similar interests (like learning a new programming language or getting in shape). This often results in people grouping up to work on their goals together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-events&quot;&gt;Social Events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least once a week, we’ll have a social event, where the group will come together and hangout. If we’re in a destination where we have kitchens &amp;amp; apartments, we’ll often do a big group potluck. If not, we’ll often do a big group dinner or happy hour followed by a game night. These events are a big part of why groups bond so closely and quickly on our trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;self-organized-events&quot;&gt;Self-organized Events&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a number of events each week that the community self-organizes around topics they’re interested in. In the past, we’ve had people organize running groups, meditation groups, writing groups, Pokemon Go trips, and a host of other activities. These vary from trip to trip, and are a great way to share your unique interests with the group!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;informally-hanging-out&quot;&gt;Informally hanging out&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts about traveling with a group is that there are always people to hang out with! Pretty much anytime you want to go out to eat or visit a local attraction, you can find several people to go with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-all-optional&quot;&gt;It’s all optional&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is required on our trips, so you can find a rhythm that works for you. Some people will be really involved, and will be at every event. Others will spend more time to themselves, and only hit the main ones (Monday lunch, Tuesday talks, Thursday demos, and the weekly social event).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever have a call that conflicts, or you want to spend some time alone, you’re free to do so! One of our facilitators may follow up and check in on you if they haven’t seen you in a few days just to make sure you’re okay, but as long as you’re alright, you’re free to participate as much or as little as makes sense for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we recommend diving in and getting super involved :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namewherenextawhere-are-you-going-next-and-when-are-you-announcing-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;where_next&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where are you going next and when are you announcing it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently in Asia, and will be heading to South America in 2017! Check out &lt;a href=&quot;#http://www.hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;our home page&lt;/a&gt; for more info about each trip. We’ll be announcing our destinations for summer 2017 and beyond early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-namewhatincludedawhats-included-in-the-price&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;what_included&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What’s included in the price?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price includes accommodations, workspace, and community events. You’re responsible for your own flights, food, and entertainment expenses. Food and entertainment typically costs around $500-800 per month in locations like Southeast Asia, and $900-1200 per month in places like Europe and Asia, depending on your spending habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nametransportationawhat-will-i-do-for-transportation&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;transportation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What will I do for transportation?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve been accepted on a trip, we’ll pass along information about the accommodations and our recommendations for airport transport. Our housing options are typically within 10-20 minute walks of the workspace. Once on the ground, you’ll most likely be traveling places on foot or using public transit. People will also occasionally rent bicycles from local vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South America -- here we come!</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/10/07/heading-to-south-america</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/10/07/heading-to-south-america</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/00comejoin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Come Join in South America&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very excited to announce that, for the first time, Hacker Paradise will be going to South America! In order to have enough time to enjoy each location, we are going to be staying in a city for 8 weeks. That means twice as much culture, twice as much food, and twice as much adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a trip you want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS – we just released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/11/01/south-america-housing-coworking/&quot;&gt;our blog post&lt;/a&gt; with housing and coworking info for South America! You can find more details there after finishing up here :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/01ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buenos Aires main&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buenos-aires-argentina-january-8---march-4&quot;&gt;Buenos Aires, Argentina (January 8 - March 4)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mix of Latin American and European influences, Buenos Aires is the cultural, political, and economic hub of Argentina. We will be centered in the Palermo neighborhood — affectionately called the Brooklyn of Buenos Aires — which is prime territory for shopping in boutique stores, discovering cozy coffee shops, and eating some of the best food Buenos Aires has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready for summer! Average highs for the time we are there will be around 27 (80 F), while the average lows hover around 20 C (68 F).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bite into a world-renowned Argentinian steak. Don’t forget the chimichurri sauce. Follow it up with some ice cream that is allegedly creamier than Italian gelato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/02ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Argentinian steak&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a stroll across the world’s widest avenue. Avenida 9 de Julio has 7 lanes in each direction and then is flanked with 4 additional parallel lanes on each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/03ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Avenida 9 de Julio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, wine country. Swish some local malbec, shiraz, and cabernet sauvignon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/04ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wine country&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been wanting to jump into the arts? Teatro Colón is considered to be one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.placestoseeinyourlifetime.com/top-10-opera-houses-in-the-world-17123/&quot;&gt;best opera houses in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/05ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Teatro Colón&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homemade empanadas are waiting for you on almost every street corner. Also, try the medialunas, the Argentinian version of a croissant that is smaller and sweeter than its French cousin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/06ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Empanadas&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/07ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Medialunas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bored with co-working spaces? Spend a day coworking at the El Ateneo Grand Splendid in Barrio Norte, one of the most beautiful bookstores in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/08ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;El Ateneo Grand Splendid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itching to join in some local festivities? We will be in Buenos Aires during Carnival! Get ready to throw some water balloons and spray foam at passerbys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/09ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Carnival&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Springboard to the beaches of Montevideo, the picturesque mountains in Patagonia, or go penguin watching in Ushuaia as you launch on an expedition to Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/11ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Patagonia&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/10ba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Penguins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/01li.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lima main&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lima-peru-march-12---may-6&quot;&gt;Lima, Peru (March 12 - May 6)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked cities of South America, Lima is a bustling metropolis nestled between the mountains and the ocean. We will be in the trendy Miraflores and Barranco neighborhoods with lots of places to eat, hang out, and explore. We’ll also be only 10-minutes from the beach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food, food, and more food. Peru has been awarded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldtravelawards.com/award-worlds-leading-culinary-destination-2015&quot;&gt;World’s Leading Culinary Destination&lt;/a&gt; for the past 4 years in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready to eat some ceviche, raw fish marinated in citrus juice and spiced with chili peppers. The fish off the coast of Lima have a unique flavor due to the type of plankton located in the area so the taste is truly one-of-a-kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/02li.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ceviche&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relax while sipping a pisco sour, a South American classic cocktail concocted from a local grape brandy, lime juice, syrup, and egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/03li.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pisco sour&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to Lima during the clear, summer months, with daily highs from 24-28 C (75-83 F) and lows from 16-19 C (61-67 F). You Instagram will be overwhelmed with breath-taking sunset shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being directly on the coast, Lima is loaded with plenty of beaches. Kick back on the sand, learn how to surf, or visit the islands off the Lima coast that are home to hundreds of sea lions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/04li.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beach&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/05li.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sea lions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern city of Lima has enveloped the ancient structures built before it. Archeological sites like Huaca Pucllana, a 7-story pyramid that predates the Incan empire by nearly 1000 years, are hidden gems tucked inside the sprawling city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/south-america-2017/06li.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pyramid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a rush of adrenaline? Get ready to paraglide by running off a 200-foot cliff to soar over the city with beautiful ocean on your left and skyscrapers on your right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machu Picchu, voted one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_the_World#Winners&quot;&gt;Seven Wonders of the New World&lt;/a&gt;, is a must see–along with the Sacred Valley, and the Inca Trail. There have been talks of imposing legislation to close or restrict access to some of these areas so the time to go is now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/08/03/asia-trip-housing</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re gearing up for our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/07/07/asia-trip/&quot;&gt;Asia trip&lt;/a&gt; starting in September!  Here is a sneak peek of the places we’ll be living and working.  It’s going to be a trip you won’t want to miss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/bali-coworking2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bali Coworking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Jeju trip is basically full, but we still have some spots left for Thailand and Bali. Early bird prices will end August 17, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org/apply&quot;&gt;apply now&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve been sitting on the fence before prices go up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jeju-island-south-korea-september-18---october-15---trip-full&quot;&gt;Jeju Island, South Korea (September 18 - October 15) - TRIP FULL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be staying at hotels in the heart of Jeju City, next to a shrine that commemorates where, according to local folklore, the islands’ progenitors first sprung out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/korea-hotel1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Korea Hotel&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/korea-hotel2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Korea Hotel&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/korea-hotel3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Korea Hotel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be working a short walk away at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jejucoworking.com/&quot;&gt;J-Space&lt;/a&gt;.  Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eODvPa-za8&quot;&gt;video walkthrough of J-space&lt;/a&gt;.  They even have 3D printers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chiang-mai-thailand-october-23---november-19---spots-available&quot;&gt;Chiang Mai, Thailand (October 23 - November 19) - SPOTS AVAILABLE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chiang Mai, we’ll be staying in the tech-savvy Nimman area sandwiched between the old city wall and Chiang Mai University.  Most of us will be in a hotel and then we’ll also have a penthouse airbnb with a pool and big common area for potlucks and events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/chiangmai-hotel1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chiang Mai Housing&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/chiangmai-hotel4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chiang Mai Housing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For coworking, we’ll have several private rooms booked in the popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ais.co.th/campais/en/&quot;&gt;CAMP&lt;/a&gt; coworking space atop the MAYA mall.  Take a break to do either karaoke or hit the gym–both options on the same floor as us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubud-bali-november-20---december-17&quot;&gt;Ubud, Bali (November 20 - December 17)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve rented out &lt;em&gt;an entire complex of villas&lt;/em&gt; near Monkey Forest for us to stay at while in Ubud.  Get excited about working poolside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/bali-hotel1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bali Housing&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016-housing/bali-hotel5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bali Housing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our partners in Bali are not holding back.  As part of our package, each participant will be receiving the following:
• Airport pick up
• Sarong (to wear in temples)
• SIM card
• Spa treatment
• Welcome dinner with performance of Balinese dancers
• One group excursion around Bali&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be coworking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hubud.org/&quot;&gt;Hubud&lt;/a&gt;, recently named by Forbes as of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kaviguppta/2016/07/15/where-to-work-the-10-best-coworking-spaces-on-earth/#61c397437e9f&quot;&gt;ten best coworking spots on Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The space has a traditional Balinese design and doesn’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We're Hiring Another Trip Leader</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/07/18/hiring-facilitator</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/07/18/hiring-facilitator</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-short&quot;&gt;In short&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend the next year traveling the world, starting in Asia this fall, while leading a ragtag crew of developers, designers, entrepreneurs, writers, project managers, and all-around cool people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-company&quot;&gt;About the company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org&quot;&gt;Hacker Paradise&lt;/a&gt; is a community of creative professionals that work while traveling the world.  We organize trips to exciting locations for people who want to have new experiences and get stuff done at the same time, attracting freelancers, remote workers, entrepreneurs, and people who simply want to take some time off and learn something new or work on side-projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live by the creed work hard, play hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-position&quot;&gt;About the position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Trip Leader to lead our Hacker Paradise fall trip that starts in September to Korea, Thailand, and Bali and wherever we decide to go after that (which you will have input on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your job is to make sure the trip runs smoothly and everyone has an awesome time. The job requires a deep understanding of who our participants are and what they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trip leader’s main goals are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate Community&lt;/strong&gt;: People that participate in Hacker Paradise trips often end up working together and forging long-lasting bonds of friendship. It’s a Trip Leader’s job to connect people, keep the community engaged, and make sure Hacker Paradise remains a safe space for everyone to come together and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Growth&lt;/strong&gt;: At Hacker Paradise, we highly value personal and professional growth. The Trip Leader works to understand the goals of each of our participants and tries to help them achieve those goals during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep things running smoothly&lt;/strong&gt;: On the trip, there will be the day-to-day of keeping the program running while also dealing with the inevitable hiccups that come along the way.  Part of the Trip Leader’s job is to handle and resolve all of this to ensure that participants have as smooth of an experience as possible and that logistics don’t get in the way of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;description-of-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Description of Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsibilities for a facilitator fall into roughly two categories: facilitating on the ground and managing the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of facilitation responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organize group activities
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Weekly talks &amp;amp; demos&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Weekly lunches&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deal with Wi-Fi issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take care of the projector, the router, and other Hacker Paradise gear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage trip budget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handle logistics for arrivals and departures
&amp;amp; Handle issues regarding housing and co-working spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of community manager responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define the initial cultural goals/values of the group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage conflict within the community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onboard and engage new members of the community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect with the local tech community through talks &amp;amp; events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cultivate connections between members of the community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interview potential candidates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek feedback from the group and iterate on our processes &amp;amp; structure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help manage the Hacker Paradise social media&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be an active participant on Slack and at social events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-were-looking-for&quot;&gt;What we’re looking for&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people who can commit to a year of traveling &amp;amp; working with Hacker Paradise. This will be split into 3 distinct 3 month trips. Each trip will have 1-2 week-long breaks in the middle where you can recharge, and there will be 3-6 weeks in between trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people who have experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizing events (conferences, hackathons, meetups, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with creative and technical people (bonus points if you’re technical yourself)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leading / managing groups of people(TA-ing in college, managing people, being a camp counselor, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolving conflict (non-violent communication, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with high autonomy, either professionally or on your own projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Living or traveling abroad for extended periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compensation&quot;&gt;Compensation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about Hacker Paradise for us has been the ability to (1) travel the world and (2) be part of a fantastic community, developing friendships that last far beyond the trips themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of financial compensation, you will receive free travel &amp;amp; housing when leading a trip and a stipend on top of that for living expenses during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-commitment&quot;&gt;Time Commitment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your role should involve an average of 30 hours per week of formal work. Some weeks may involve more or less than that depending on activities, and there may be a fair amount of informal work (people asking you about logistics at dinner or during off-hours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Trip Leader should have enough time time to work on side projects. However, Hacker Paradise must be your number one priority during this period, and if a conflict arises, we’ll expect you to put your role with us over your other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in the position? &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IE6qmH67KYRJCXjELbAjJxbvEBdFobp6NEPyrr4uGgE/viewform&quot;&gt;Apply here&lt;/a&gt; or email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:facilitators@hackerparadise.org&quot;&gt;facilitators@hackerparadise.org&lt;/a&gt; by August 1, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explore Asia with us this fall!</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/07/07/asia-trip</link>

      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/07/07/asia-trip</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that, by popular request, we’ll be heading to Asia this fall! We’ll be visiting South Korea, Thailand, and Bali for great food and unforgettable cultural experiences. See below for more info on each location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jeju-island-south-korea-september-18---october-15&quot;&gt;Jeju Island, South Korea (September 18 - October 15)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeju, often regarded as the “Korean Hawaii”, is 60 miles southwest of the southern tip of South Korea.  It is an up-and-coming tech hot spot in Korea and boasts a warm climate, beautiful beaches, and tropical mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/jeju/waterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jeju waterfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeju’s landscape includes South Korea’s highest peak, dormant volcanoes, and underground lava tunnels. Here are some of the famed peaks of the island: Mt. Hallansan and Mt. Sanbang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/jeju/hallasan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mt Hallasan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/jeju/sanbang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mt Sanbang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early fall weather is outstanding in Jeju.  The average high is 75 F (24 C) and the water temperature is 74 F (23 C), so we’ll be spending some time hanging out at the beach! Also, one of our facilitators is a Korean language and culture instructor, so you can pick up some Korean while you’re there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean food is incredibly diverse, ranging from marinated BBQ to vegetarian delights to street food that will blow the socks off the Korean taco trucks you’ve eaten at before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/jeju/table_spread.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Korean Table Spread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also hold some professional events with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakao&quot;&gt;Kakao&lt;/a&gt;, one of South Korea’s top tech companies. They run a super popular instant messaging app in Asia (160 million users spread out over 230 countries), and are the company that acquired &lt;a href=&quot;https://path.com/&quot;&gt;Path&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most exciting thing about this trip is that the local Jeju Government will be sponsoring free housing for everyone in the group, so you’ll just pay the Hacker Paradise program fee for this leg of the trip! Here’s the government-sponsored coworking space that will serve as our HQ during our time there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/jeju/coworking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jeju Coworking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS - Korea has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_South_Korea&quot;&gt;fastest average Internet connection&lt;/a&gt; in the world :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chiang-mai-thailand-october-23---november-19&quot;&gt;Chiang Mai, Thailand (October 23 - November 19)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re heading back to Chiang Mai for the second leg of our Asia tour, as it consistently ranks as people’s favorite destination whenever we go to Asia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucked away in the beautiful mountains of northern Thailand, Chiang Mai is known for its incredible hiking and trekking, warm and welcoming locals, and a relaxing air of Buddhist spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are there, Chiang Mai will be celebrating the Thai Festival of Lights (November 13-15), a beautiful spectacle where thousands lanterns released into the sky. Check it out below - this is a bucket-list experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/chiang_mai/festival_of_lights.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Festival of the Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chiang Mai city area has over 300 Buddhist temples,70% is covered by mountains and vegetation, and is home to Thailand’s highest mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/chiang_mai/inthanon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Doi Inthanon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand is also the birthplace of Muay Thai. It’s also known as the ‘art of eight limbs,’ because boxers use elbows, knees, and shins in addition to their fists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/chiang_mai/muay_thai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Muay Thai&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather in Chiang Mai is perfect in the fall. The cool season starts in November and is typified by dry weather and temperatures ranging from 60 F (15 C) to 80 F (25 C) in the valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Thailand is overflowing with local culture and tradition, you’ll never be far from the homeland comforts you crave.  We’ll be staying near Maya, a large Western-style mall, and Thailand has the second most 7-11s in the world (Japan is the only country with more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we should mention that Thai food in Thailand is absolutely amazing. Here’s a picture of Khao Soi, a popular dish in the North:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/chiang_mai/khao_soi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Khao Soi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubud-bali-november-20---december-17&quot;&gt;Ubud, Bali (November 20 - December 17)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody loves Bali! Popularized by the book Eat, Pray, Love, Bali is renowned as a community for yoga / meditation, as well as a mecca for surfers with a rich cultural and natural landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arriving in Bali, you’ll quickly become a millionaire – in Indonesian rupiah! 1 USD is about equal to 13,100 IDR, so you’ll have more rupiahs then you know what to do with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubud, where we’ll be staying, is probably the yoga capital of the world. Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, you can find a range of classes in all different types of yoga, as well as workshops in other meditation and spiritual practices, such as ecstatic dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/bali/yoga.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yoga&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bali, you can also partake in a cup of the world’s rarest and most expensive coffee.  Kopi Luwak is created from coffee beans that have passed through the digestive system of the cat-like Indonesian civet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/bali/civet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Civet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/bali/civet_coffee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Civet Eating Coffee Beans&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bali is also the perfect jumping off point for the 921 other inhabited islands in Indonesia.  If you’re feeling adventurous, you could also venture off to one of the estimated 16,586 uninhabited islands in the archipelago and plant the Hacker Paradise flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/bali/black_sand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Black Sand&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We highly recommend taking a weekend during your stay to climb Mount  Batur, one of Bali’s twin active volcanoes, to watch the sunrise.  You can also venture to Pura Besakih, a large temple the overlooks Mt. Agung, Bali’s other active volcano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/asia-2016/bali/agung.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mt. Agung&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, get your SLR camera and your Instagram account ready for lots of beautiful temples &amp;amp; sunsets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Join us in Portugal this summer!</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/02/12/heading-to-porto</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/02/12/heading-to-porto</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/porto/porto_top.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Porto, Portugal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org&quot;&gt;Hacker Paradise&lt;/a&gt; will be heading to Portugal for 3 months this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June 5 to August 27, we’ll be staying in the historic downtown of Porto, a short walk from the River Douro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to get work done and enjoy one of the best places to spend summer in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great chance to dive into Portuguese culture - we’ll be organizing events with the local tech scene and hiring a local Portuguese instructor for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-why-porto&quot;&gt;So, why Porto?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;porto-is-an-under-the-radar-city-along-the-banks-of-the-beautiful-river-douro&quot;&gt;Porto is an under-the-radar city along the banks of the beautiful River Douro:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/porto/porto_panorama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The River Douro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-weather-in-the-summer-is-absolutely-amazing&quot;&gt;The weather in the summer is absolutely amazing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average daily high from July 2015 was 75 F (24 C), and it never got above 80 F (27 C) - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accuweather.com/en/pt/porto/275317/july-weather/275317?monyr=7/1/2015&quot;&gt;source Accuweather&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it much more livable in the summer than cities like Barcelona and Lisbon, which regularly reach the high 90s F (30s C).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;porto-is-a-coastal-city-so-beaches-are-just-a-short-ride-away&quot;&gt;Porto is a coastal city, so beaches are just a short ride away:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/porto/matosinhos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matosinhos Beach&quot; /&gt;
(Matosinhos beach - &lt;a href=&quot;http://magicseaweed.com/Matosinhos-Surf-Report/942/&quot;&gt;surf report&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;porto-is-rich-in-architecture-and-history-its-historic-district-is-a-unesco-world-heritage-site&quot;&gt;Porto is rich in architecture and history. Its historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site:&lt;/h3&gt;

(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribeira_Square&quot;&gt;Praca de Ribeira&lt;/a&gt;)

&lt;h3 id=&quot;porto-is-also-the-birthplace-of-port-wine&quot;&gt;Porto is also the birthplace of Port wine:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/porto/croft_port_wine_cellars.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Croft Port Wine Cellars&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-weekends-explore-the-vineyards-of-the-douro-valley-that-lie-outside-the-city&quot;&gt;On the weekends, explore the vineyards of the Douro Valley that lie outside the city:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/porto/douro_valley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Douro Valley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us for the European summer in Porto while building cool things and hanging out with amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve rented out several houses downtown in the Vitoria neighborhood (check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/4050-161+Vit%C3%B3ria,+Portugal/@41.1471772,-8.6325639,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd2464e29181e5cd:0x4f8481000a26f30a&quot;&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Hacker Paradise - Tokyo Drift</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/01/06/tokyo-trip</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2016 04:32:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2016/01/06/tokyo-trip</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tokyo-2015/barcamp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;barcamp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first arrived in Tokyo, we weren’t sure exactly what to expect. We were excited to see a whole new culture few of us had explored before. We never really truly realized what we would find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to think of a city we’ve been to so far that has been as electric as Tokyo, Japan. Whether it was riding the Shinkansen bullet trains, meeting the creator of Ruby, or hitting up the Tsukiji Fish Market at 4am for tuna sashimi that’s so fresh it’s almost breathing, there was never a dull moment at Hacker Paradise - Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tokyo-hq-case-shinjuku&quot;&gt;Tokyo HQ: CASE Shinjuku&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CASE Shinjuku and its incredibly courteous and friendly staff became our new home and family in Japan. This beautiful, clean, modern coworking space was complete with new furniture, great ambient music and fun extendo-outlets that hang down from the ceiling, was the perfect space to work from.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tokyo-2015/case.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;case&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operation-food-indulgence&quot;&gt;Operation: Food-Indulgence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sushi train! A sushi train! Our kingdom for another sushi train! From the succulent and delicious katsu-don, to the group-favourite conveyor belt sushi, the food in Japan was world-class. It’s hard to beat beautifully-cheap, fresh sushi come on an express train bound for your table.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tokyo-2015/sushi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sushi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-of-us-were-spirited-away&quot;&gt;Some of us were spirited away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being dunked into the inkwell of Hayao Miyazaki imagination in the Studio Ghibli museum was awe-inspiring. With his colorful photography-inspired landscapes covering the walls, it was difficult not to get sucked into a world of fantasy, magic, and traditional Japanese culture.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tokyo-2015/ghibli.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ghibli&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halloween-was-a-big-deal&quot;&gt;Halloween was a big deal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween was not something we expected in Japan. As it turned out, Halloween was only brought to and commercialized in Japan about 4 years ago. Because of this, it was a huge deal in Tokyo with parties every weekend throughout the whole month of October and topped off with hoards of elaborate costumes flocking to the streets. Our crew followed suit.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tokyo-2015/halloween.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;halloween&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-pretty-awesome-guest-speakers&quot;&gt;Some pretty awesome guest speakers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were in Tokyo, we had the pleasure of learning about the startup scene from Disrupting Japan’s Tim Romero, Patrick McKenzie, CEO of Starfighter; and Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), creator of Ruby.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tokyo-2015/matz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;matz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing our Contributor Program</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/09/14/contributor-program</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/09/14/contributor-program</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hacker Paradise is a great experience for developers, designers, and entrepreneurs who want to travel and meet awesome people. Our past participants have launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://antipoachingmap.org/&quot;&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://theuserisdrunk.com/&quot;&gt;cool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlieguo.com/unscalable&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt;, and many of them end up making friends for life. Some of them even end up working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it takes a lot of work behind the scenes to screen everyone, scout hotels, and facilitate the community, our trips cost more than traveling on your own. For many people, the added value of being part of this tight-knit tech community on the road is more than worth it, and they’re happy to contribute financially to keep the community going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we realize that there people out there who have a lot to contribute to the community, but don’t have as much financial freedom. Some examples of people in this group are students, people who work for non-profits, bootstrapping entrepreneurs, and people from the developing world - all may be talented and awesome, and yet still have a hard time pulling together the funds to come on one of our trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been thinking for awhile about we can reach out to these communities and make Hacker Paradise more accessible for them in a way that aligns with our values, as we believe that having a diverse group benefits everyone on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, today, we’re happy to announce that we’re launching an experimental Contributor Program, where people can trade skilled work for Hacker Paradise in exchange for a discount on their program fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that while some people contribute financially to keep the community going, skilled people who have less cash available can make in-kind contributions to the community instead. In exchange for 3-5 hours per week of work, contributors will get 50% off the Hacker Paradise program fee (not including housing). Here’s how it compares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you work on? Ideally, you’d propose a couple of projects, and then we’d work together to find something along those lines that is both fair and benefits Hacker Paradise or the broader community. Here are some examples of possible projects you could work on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizing a BarCamp or other major event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping us build / maintain internal software tools (Rails, Jekyll, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping us automate / improve our internal processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing posts for our blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping us with social media or other marketing initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping us with scouting or other operational work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help us with a logo, infographic, or other design asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be trying out the program with a limited number of slots for our fall batch to Japan / Taiwan, and then may continue it in the spring and beyond. If interested, please apply using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q-wrcGjSAAWQUoEIuVpwzEwjtqctKYWyvNlTxAk5Dzg/viewform&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also still have some external diversity grants available. If interested in those, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/diversity-grant/&quot;&gt;check them out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barcelona Highlights</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/08/24/barcelona-highlights</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/08/24/barcelona-highlights</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/barceloneta.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;barceloneta&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barcelona is known for three things: beach, culture, and nightlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, our first week in Barcelona coincided with Running of the Bulls, and a few of the more adventurous members of our group joined in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/pamplona.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pamplona&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly settled into our new home at Betahaus, Barcelona. It’s a cool space with a good vibe, but the highlight of our trip was the rooftop terrace, which gave breathtaking sunset views of the city. Many nights were spent hanging out up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/rooftop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rooftop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barcelona is also well-known for its street art. The one rule in street art is: “Don’t paint over someone’s tag with a lesser piece.” As a result, local store owners will pay for prominent street artists to paint their doors and so that they don’t become defaced with low quality tags. This was our favorite piece we came across:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/grafitti.png&quot; alt=&quot;grafitti&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about Barcelona is the nightlife! People explored salsa, saw David Guetta live at a local music festival, and ate oh so many tapas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/tapas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tapas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partway through the month, we co-hosted an event with one Typeform, a local venture-backed startup with ~40 employees. Members of both the Typeform and Hacker Paradise teams gave informative talks on web-performance, deep-learning, and dealing with impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/typeform.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;typeform&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People would use the mornings to relax on the beach or to explore the architectural works of Antoni Gaudi, in particular his Park Güell and the famed Sagrada Familia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/sagrada.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sagrada&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one of the last weekends, we took a cable-car ride up to Monserrat Abbey and hiked along the Sant Jeroni trail. Along the way, we took in breathtaking panoramic views of Catalonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/montserrat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;monsterrat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the month, we held a group-wide hackathon. One team built an app to help prevent poaching in Africa, the Anti-Poaching Map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team was led by Tim Masson, an engineer and entrepreneur from the U.K. who has spent the last 15 years living in Zimbabwe, and 6 other developers, designers, and content creators came on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a day, the site came together, and the team has continued working on it since, recently launching an IndieGoGo campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/barcelona-2015/antipoaching.png&quot; alt=&quot;anti-poaching map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound like fun? We’ve got a bunch of trips lined up for the next 6 months, including places like Japan, Taiwan, Bali, and Thailand. You can find out more on our home page or apply here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tallinn: The Hidden (startup) Gem of Europe</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/06/25/tallinn-the-hidden-startup-gem-of-europe</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/06/25/tallinn-the-hidden-startup-gem-of-europe</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 4 lovely weeks in Tallinn, the Hacker Paradise team has officially dubbed it the hidden gem of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/city.png&quot; alt=&quot;tallinn-city&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, we were greeted by 20 hours of sunlight, affordable food, and a gorgeous medieval town. We have spent our days working out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hub.garage48.org/&quot;&gt;Garage48&lt;/a&gt;, the coworking space home to dozens of prior Skype employees, now building their own startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/pingpong.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pingpong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are puppies, ping pong tables, and snacks. Making this coworking space feel like you are in the heart of Silicon Valley, but without the prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/garage48.png&quot; alt=&quot;garage48&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this month we have met with awesome local startup leaders such as Sten Tamkivi, the founder of Teleport, a tool for digital nomads and location independent workers. We learned about his experience at the early days of Skype, transitioning to working on his own project, and growing a remote team around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/taavi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;taavi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also &lt;a href=&quot;www.hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/06/17/welcome-to-e-stonia&quot;&gt;met the CIO of Estonia at the Ministry of Economy, Taavi Kotka&lt;/a&gt;, who discussed the benefits of e-Residency and X-Road. At Garage48 we worked next to startups like Toggl, Transferwise, and Investly sharing coffee and startup stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/whiteboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;whiteboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants have taken weekend trips to Tartu to get a taste of a University town in Estonia, Riga for a Salsa Dancing Conference, Helsinki to meet up with Hacker Paradise Alum and Stockholm to celebrate 2 Midsummers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/max-midsummer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;midsummer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have explored catacombs, adventure into Estonian saunas, and celebrated Midsummer on the beach with a bonfire the size of 3 Ubers. Every Monday we meet at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.revalcafe.ee/&quot;&gt;Reval Cafe&lt;/a&gt; for our weekly check-ins. Reval is a quant cafe chain Tallinn, but this location quickly became our favorite with its medieval stone walls, candles and royal red couches. Top it off with fast wifi and delicious food and we are happy hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/cafe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cafe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The month in Tallinn flew by, and we are headed to Barcelona next. We are excited for a bit warmer weather and beaches, but the Baltic sea and 7 hour sunsets will surely be missed. Cheers to discovering a hidden gem of Europe and a booming startup scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/tallinn-2015/city-panorama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tallinn-city&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/janemuts&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaiisand&quot;&gt;Kai&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Garage48HUB&quot;&gt;@Garage48&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/seikatsu&quot;&gt;@Sten&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TeleportInc&quot;&gt;@Teleport&lt;/a&gt; team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taavikotka&quot;&gt;@Taavi&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/e_estonia&quot;&gt;@Estonian Govt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martingryner&quot;&gt;@Martin&lt;/a&gt; for organizing the Catacombs tour and sauna trip. You were great hosts; thanks for making us feel welcome and at home in Estonia!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet Europe's top CIO - Estonian Taavi Kotka</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/06/17/welcome-to-e-stonia</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/06/17/welcome-to-e-stonia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cliparts.co/cliparts/ki8/nKG/ki8nKGGBT.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You decide to go fishing. You get your gear, pack your car, drive down to a good spot. You also need to get your fishing permit. The cost is 10 Euros. You can send an SMS to get the fee added to your phone bill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Just in case, a patrol car drives by to check that everybody has paid for their license.  How can we prevent somebody from buying the license only when they hear the patrol coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like a product/systems design question&lt;/strong&gt;. PM interviews are full of them. Instead, it was a very real problem facing Estonia’s CIO.  Try to figure out the solution yourself, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyMK/10844fd9e888ef691bd2/raw/7768a951b9cd0151579549ff184bce9407689764/gistfile1.txt&quot;&gt;see the answer once ready&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unexpected-taavi-kotka&quot;&gt;The Unexpected Taavi Kotka&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unexpected” sums up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/taavi-kotka/33/35b/263&quot;&gt;Taavi Kotka&lt;/a&gt;, (and, to a degree, Estonia) rather well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.aripaev.ee/storyimage/EA/20150306/OPINION/150309757/AR/0/AR-150309757.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After studying Computer Science and spending more than a decade as co-owner and then Managing Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nortal.com/&quot;&gt;largest Enterprise Software company in Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, Taavi sold his shares in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then decided to go back to school for a Ph.D in Computer Science, but not before accepting an invitation from the Estonian government to become the country’s first CIO. These days, he meets with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20150614/jeb-bush-has-much-to-prove-in-leaderless-gop-presidential-race&quot;&gt;foreign dignitaries&lt;/a&gt; curious about the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-21&quot;&gt;E-stonian miracle&lt;/a&gt;,” and is spearheading the world’s first &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/about/&quot;&gt;E-Residency&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taavis-digital-it-philosophy&quot;&gt;Taavi’s Digital IT Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the digital world, all countries are the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taavi argues that the services each country needs to offer online are fundamentally the same. The difference between countries with two million and two hundred million residents ends up being the number of rows in the database. These days, through virtualization and cloud services, data storage is cheap enough for storage costs not to dominate IT costs. Since Estonia doesn’t have a particularly big population and a small IT budget, the solutions they came up with had to be very cost-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great - so can we all just copy the Estonian model? With time; most governments have legacy identification systems that will need to be maintained for years to come, and which drastically increase support costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daddy-why-are-there-ropes-here&quot;&gt;“Daddy, why are there ropes here?”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After I sold my shares in 2012, I took my two kids (four and five) to the US for a world tour. We landed in JFK and were waiting in the immigration line. My children didn’t understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.travelwithmiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Immigration-Line.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; “Why are there ropes here, daddy?”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; “Well, honey, it’s so that people can get in order so they can queue”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; “What’s a queue, daddy?”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; “Well, it’s a line so people can wait so they can talk to the immigration officer in order”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; “Oh. (pause) Isn’t there just an app for that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meanwhile-in-estonia&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, in Estonia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Estonia, every citizen receives a government-issued ID card at birth. The ID contains a crypto key which can be used to securely sign documents, view healthcare records, bank and even vote online. Jeb Bush &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-estonians-can-file-their-taxes-five-/&quot;&gt;recently apologized&lt;/a&gt; for claiming it takes five minutes to file taxes in Estonia. Apparently, it only takes two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this come to pass? In the early nineties, a newly-independent Estonia found itself with almost no legacy systems to support, a tight budget, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-21&quot;&gt;reformist government with an average age of 35&lt;/a&gt;. TCP-IP as a protocol for sending information around was just becoming dominant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They went for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;x-road-the-government-as-protocol&quot;&gt;X-Road: the Government as Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backbone of Estonia’s IT success has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-estonia.com/component/x-road/&quot;&gt;X-Road project&lt;/a&gt;, a government-mandated standard that describes how information needs to flow between government and private databases, what checks and balances need to exist to ensure information isn’t being stolen or abused, and the protocol for how the various services should communicate. The Digital ID card, and its ability to generate PIN-backed signatures, is a cornerstone of making the system effective and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.jjy1058.com/2015/04/22/interacciatildesup3nentregobiernoyciudadanos-l-d3b9708e74c6656f.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One novel component in the X-Road system is the lack of a giant central server with all the information. Instead, information is intentionally silo-ed and distributed: a service-oriented architecture &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.circleci.com/its-the-future/&quot;&gt;before it was cool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taavi spoke about the implications a decentralized standard, instead of a monolithic set of servers, had on cost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recently rewrote the X-Road implementation, migrating it from C to Java. The &lt;strong&gt;whole thing cost five hundred thousand dollars&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the budget of just the healthcare.gov project, I could run &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Estonia’s Government IT for &lt;strong&gt;fifteen years&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-e-residency-the-future-of-government-services&quot;&gt;Is E-Residency the future of government services?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most novel project that Taavi has been spearheading as CIO has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/news/international/21605923-national-identity-scheme-goes-global-estonia-takes-plunge&quot;&gt;Estonian E-Residency&lt;/a&gt;. Launched &lt;strong&gt;into beta&lt;/strong&gt; in November 2014, E-Residency offers a digital ID card and access to Estonia’s network of services - currently, banking and digital signatures - for anybody with 50 Euros and the willingness to fill out an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, suggests Taavi, people will be able to pick and choose which government they procure which services from. Say your home country has complex processes required to register your location-independent business. Why not register it in Estonia, with its friendly tax policy, EU membership and trustworthy banking system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, Taavi hopes to bring in more companies to offer services to its E-Residents, extending “Estonia as a Platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If E-Residency sounds good, come join Taavi’s version of the future and &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-estonia.com/e-residents/apply/&quot;&gt;apply today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacker Paradise met with Taavi Kotka during our month-long stay in Tallinn. Thanks for meeting us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taavikotka&quot;&gt;@taavikotka&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We're Hiring a Trip Leader</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/05/07/hiring-trip-leader</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/05/07/hiring-trip-leader</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-short&quot;&gt;In short&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend the next year traveling the world leading a ragtag crew of awesome developers, designers, and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We (Casey and Alexey) have been doing this ourselves for almost a year now, having run trips to Costa Rica, South East Asia, and now Europe. We’ve gotten a lot of interest and are now ready to bring on other trip leaders as we work to grow the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-company&quot;&gt;About the company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker Paradise gives tech and creative types the experience of true community while living a location-independent lifestyle. We organize trips around the world for people who want to travel and get stuff done at the same time, attracting freelancers, remote workers, entrepreneurs, and people who simply want to take some time off and learn something new or work on side-projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders, Casey and Alexey, met at UPenn and have spent a lot of time as organizers for the tech community.Alexey started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pennapps.com&quot;&gt;PennApps hackathon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://internproject.io/&quot;&gt;The Intern Project&lt;/a&gt;; Casey created the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gophergala.com/&quot;&gt;Gopher Gala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned what a productive community environment feels like from working at places like Facebook, Dropbox and Pebble. Outside of work, you can find us cycling, meditating, playing board games, drumming, climbing, tossing a frisbee, or playing soccer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-position&quot;&gt;About the position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Trip Leader at Hacker Paradise is someone who leads a Hacker Paradise trip (like the recent Southeast Asia trip to Vietnam, Bali, and Thailand, or the upcoming Europe trip to Estonia, Barcelona, and Berlin) and ensures everybody on the trip has an awesome time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job requires a deep understanding of who our participants are and what they are looking for. A Trip Leader’s main goals are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate Community&lt;/strong&gt;: people that come to Hacker Paradise trips often end up working together and forging long-lasting bonds of friendship. It’s a Trip Leader’s job to connect people, keep the community engaged, and make sure Hacker Paradise remains a safe space for everyone to come together and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Growth&lt;/strong&gt;: at Hacker Paradise, we highly value personal and professional growth. The Trip Leader works to understand the goals of each of our participants and tries to help them achieve those goals during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the trains running on time&lt;/strong&gt;: we do a fair amount of preparation before a trip begins to make sure things run smoothly (scout the location, make deals with housing and coworking, short-list locations for meals and demos, etc.), but there will inevitably be hiccups along the way. Part of the Trip Leader’s job is to deal with any issues that arise due to operations to ensure that participants have as smooth of an experience as possible and that logistics don’t get in the way of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who is excited about having a high degree of autonomy and the responsibility to shape the role, iterate on aspects of the community, and constantly work to improve the trip experience. Casey and Alexey have been Trip Leaders for every trip thus far and are eager to share their experience and advice, but ultimately the success of each trip will lie with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;description-of-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Description of Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsibilities for a facilitator fall into roughly two categories: facilitating the community and handling on-the-ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of facilitation responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define the initial cultural goals/values of the group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organize group activities
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Weekly talks&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Weekly demo nights&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Monthly hack days&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap people to lead mastermind groups and regular stand-ups / check-ins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap people to give talks and put on workshops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage people in the community to self-organize and scratch their own itches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage conflict within the community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onboard and engage new members of the community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect with the local tech community through talks &amp;amp; events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cultivate connection between members of the community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interview potential candidates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek feedback from the group and iterate on our processes &amp;amp; structure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come up with new ways to help support people in reaching their goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of operational responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interact with the coworking space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deal with Wi-Fi issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run group meals &amp;amp; an (optional) group trip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work with local vendor we’ve chosen to handle airport pickup &amp;amp; SIM cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take care of the projector, the router, and other Hacker Paradise gear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask people for money in person if they don’t respond to our emails / messages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay local vendors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-well-be-supporting-you&quot;&gt;How we’ll be supporting you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things we’ll be doing behind the scenes so that you can focus on creating an awesome experience for the members of our community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scouting, negotiating with hotels / coworking spaces, and pre-trip logistics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding exercises / activities you can use to help cultivate community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marketing &amp;amp; getting the word out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing bookings and arriivals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handling finances for the trip (collecting money, paying vendors, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing the interview / application process (although you’ll be one of the interviewers and will play an active role in improving the process)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-were-looking-for&quot;&gt;What we’re looking for&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people who can commit to a year of traveling &amp;amp; working with Hacker Paradise. This will be split into 3 distinct 3 month trips. Each trip will have 1-2 week-long breaks in the middle where you can recharge, and there will be 3-6 weeks in between trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people who:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have experience organizing events - conferences, hackathons, meetups, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are excited about creating an awesome community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have been in a role with high autonomy (professional or otherwise)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have spent a lot of time around technical people (or are technical themselves)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are experienced in leadership/coaching (TA-ing in college, manager, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have spent time living / traveling abroad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points for experience in community management or conflict resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application will involve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interviews with current team members&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;References for past work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finalists will be invited to help us run our Europe trip this summer for a month as a trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compensation&quot;&gt;Compensation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about Hacker Paradise for us has been the ability to (1) travel the world and (2) be part of a fantastic community, developing friendships that last far beyond the trips themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of financial compensation, we’re still figuring out exactly what that looks like and can be flexible depending on a trip leader’s preferences. That said, we can promise the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free travel &amp;amp; housing when leading a trip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stipend for living expenses during the trip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue share based on number of participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-commitment&quot;&gt;Time Commitment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each role should involve an average of 30 hours per week of formal work. Some weeks may involve more or less than that depending on activities, and there may be a fair amount of informal work (people asking you about logistics at dinner or during off-hours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Trip Leader should have enough time time to work on side projects (we do). However, Hacker Paradise must be your number one priority during this period, and if a conflict arises, we’ll expect you to put your role with us over your other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in the position? &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IE6qmH67KYRJCXjELbAjJxbvEBdFobp6NEPyrr4uGgE/viewform&quot;&gt;Apply here&lt;/a&gt; or just email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:facilitators@hackerparadise.org&quot;&gt;facilitators@hackerparadise.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons Learned in 6 Months of Marketing Experimentation</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/05/06/marketing-lessons-learned</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/05/06/marketing-lessons-learned</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 6 months, we’ve grown our mailing list from 500 to 10,000+ subscribers while spending less than $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t see many startups talking publicly about the successes and failures of their marketing strategies, so in this post, we want to talk a bit about what worked, what didn’t, and things that we’ve learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are is a high level overview of the different customer acquisition channels we’ve experimented with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product Hunt - Ryan Hoover Says We’re “Not a Product” - 590 unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hacker News - Our User is Drunk - 3,648 unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PR - Our Customers Don’t Read TechCrunch Anymore - 971 unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social Media - Auto-following Actually Seems to Work - 2,318 unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coworking Raffle - Holy $@%^, We Went Viral - 21,273 unique visitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the above channels drew some traffic to our site, but our raffle was an order of magnitude more successful than our other initiatives. Read on for our takeaways from each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-hunt---590-unique-visitors&quot;&gt;Product Hunt - 590 unique visitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Within a few hours, they’d deleted us from their feed.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a channel that we’d believed to have high potential, but ultimately, it didn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After posting our site to their general submission box a few times without getting Hunted, we realized that there were a number of power users on the site whose links got Hunted automatically without any review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uUe0YoYJw2qsMHCmFibnm-2diWlL8xNvSVgzDfXENto/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a list of 30+ power users&lt;/a&gt;, and found a few people who we had connections to. We reached out to one of them, and he thought what we were doing was cool, so agreed to Hunt our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things started out well. After posting, we started trending almost immediately and they sent out a Tweet promoting us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/product_hunt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Product Hunt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, things quickly turned sour. Within a few hours, they’d deleted us from their feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few emails back and forth with Ryan Hoover, we were told that we had been deleted for being “outside the scope of a ‘product.’” This was super frustrating, as there weren’t (and I believe, still aren’t) any concrete guidelines for what Product Hunt deems to be a “product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, not to be discouraged, we decided to make a mini-product, &lt;a href=&quot;http://workaway.io&quot;&gt;workaway.io&lt;/a&gt;, which would be an aggregator of communities like ours. We spent a day or two putting it together, and then asked our same friend to hunt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got deleted in under 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we realized that it probably wasn’t a good use of our time to continue building things specifically for Product Hunt, and we haven’t really focused on it as a marketing channel since. Still, when people post things that are related to our space, we try to join the conversation and leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned---product-hunt&quot;&gt;Lessons learned - Product Hunt:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Hunt can be a great way to get traffic, but the moderation team can be fickle, so don’t rely upon it. Try to position yourself as a “product” as much as possible, although there are no concrete guidelines for what this means. Engaging in the community seems to be worthwhile, and if you’re having trouble getting Hunted, reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uUe0YoYJw2qsMHCmFibnm-2diWlL8xNvSVgzDfXENto/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;power users&lt;/a&gt; whose submissions get Hunted automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hacker-news---3648-unique-visitors&quot;&gt;Hacker News - 3,648 unique visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This… was more than double the traffic we got from TechCrunch and The Guardian combined.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker News has been a solid source of traffic for us, and we think that we’ve only begun to scratch the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of submitting our own content, we’ve had great success from actively engaging in discussions with the community. On a semi-regular basis, there are posts about travel, digital nomadism, or one of the other players in our emerging space, and we’ve had a number of people apply after interacting with us in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, one of the largest Hacker News-related sources of traffic has been www.theuserisdrunk.com. One of our participants made this at a hack day during our trip, and when it started trending on Hacker News, we asked him to put a “Made at Hacker Paradise” line at the very bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/user_is_drunk.png&quot; alt=&quot;User is Drunk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, The User is Drunk trended at #1 for almost an entire day, bringing him over 120,000 unique visitors. Out of those, over 2,500 clicked through to our site. This alone was more than double the traffic we got from TechCrunch and The Guardian combined (more on that below), and emphasizes how powerful it can be to hit that #1 spot and stay there for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total unique visitors directly from Hacker News: &lt;strong&gt;403&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total unique visitors from The User is Drunk: &lt;strong&gt;2,881&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned---hacker-news&quot;&gt;Lessons learned - Hacker News:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get on the front page of Hacker News is a bit of a gamble, but when it works, it pays off in spades. Keeping an eye out for posts related to your business and interacting with people in the comments is a less impactful but more reliable way to get traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pr---971-unique-visitors&quot;&gt;PR - 971 unique visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“People are getting less and less news directly from news sites in favor of socially curated sites like Hacker News and Reddit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/techcrunch.png&quot; alt=&quot;TechCrunch&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/guardian.png&quot; alt=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we were mentioned in a few sentences in a Guardian article on “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/28/co-working-holidays-new-travel-trend&quot;&gt;co-working holidays&lt;/a&gt;,” so we reached out to the writer to see if she’d be interested in coming to Bali and checking out our trip in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian sent her and a photographer to join us in Bali for a week to get the full Hacker Paradise experience, and being freelance journalists, the two of them integrated seamlessly into our group. A few weeks after they got back to London, The Guardian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/apr/07/meet-entrepreneurs-jetting-off-co-working-holidays&quot;&gt;published their piece&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out great, but didn’t drive a ton of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total unique visitors from The Guardian (across both articles): &lt;strong&gt;323&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, an alumni from our first trip connected us to a TechCrunch contributor who was looking to write something on the phenomena of working &amp;amp; traveling. A week later, we had an interview, and several days after that, we were &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/18/oh-the-places-you-will-go-with-hackers/&quot;&gt;live on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;. This article sent us a bit more traffic, but its effects were still quite underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total unique visitors from TechCrunch: &lt;strong&gt;648&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason we think that the articles didn’t drive a ton of traffic is that fewer people are reading news direct from the source anymore. Instead, they rely upon socially-curated news sites like Hacker News and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that a “Made at Hacker Paradise” line at the very bottom of The User is Drunk (which hit #1 on Hacker News) drove over twice the combined traffic of TechCrunch and The Guardian seems to confirm this quite clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned---pr&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned - PR:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was surprising to us how effective it was to just reach out to a journalist on Twitter who had written about our space. If you’re interested in pursuing PR, you should keep a list of all journalists who have written about related topics and ping them with ideas &amp;amp; opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, people are getting less and less news directly from news sites in favor of aggregators like Hacker News and Reddit. If you’re hoping an article about your company will drive traffic, it needs to be interesting enough to succeed on these social news sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are still benefits to being covered in the mainstream media, such as the credibility that comes with adding an “As Seen in TechCrunch” or “As Seen in The Guardian” logo to your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media---2318-unique-visitors&quot;&gt;Social Media - 2,318 unique visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Auto-favoriting and follow marketing actually seem to work.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several things we’ve tried with social media:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posting regular pictures from our trips&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto-favoriting Tweets about topics related to work &amp;amp; travel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following people who follow other Twitter accounts in our space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media seems to be surprisingly effective - we’ve had several people who ended up coming on our trips after we favorited one of their Tweets or followed them. Since it’s hard to measure the effects and ROI on our time, we’ve deemphasized this. However, we may experiment with it again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also think our regular social media posts are worthwhile. A large number of our applicants come through word of mouth, and we believe that posting photos to Twitter and Facebook helps to tell our story, gives our participants things to share, and shows people what it’s like to join one of our trips. I mean, hell, who wouldn’t want to work here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/luka_rooftop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Luka @ A La Carte Rooftop Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Da Nang, Vietnam)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total traffic from Twitter (pre-raffle): &lt;strong&gt;664&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total traffic from Facebook (pre-raffle): &lt;strong&gt;1,654&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned---social-media&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned - Social Media:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto-favoriting and follow marketing actually seem to work, although it’s unclear how effective they are in relation to the amount of time invested. Another takeaway from writing this article is that we probably need to get better at measuring the effects of our social media campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;raffle---21273-unique-visitors&quot;&gt;Raffle - 21,273 unique visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We were blown away by how much attention this got.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has singlehandedly been the most effective thing we’ve done for marketing in the last 6 months, and has driven exponentially more traffic &amp;amp; signups to the site than any other channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got started when back in March, we did a marketing brainstorm to come up with ways we could raise awareness for Hacker Paradise among remote developers. One idea we had was to throw a hackathon focused on digital nomadism / remote work, and one of the prizes we were thinking of offering was a free year of coworking around the world - one month free at 12 different spaces all over the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when we came up with the idea of doing a raffle. It seemed like a way to attract people to an awesome prize without having to organize a hackathon, which we knew from experience takes a ton of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached out to a number of coworking spaces, and many of them immediately signed up to be a part of the raffle. Since it doesn’t really cost a coworking space much to have one additional person, most of them treated it as an opportunity for free publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had 12 spaces on board within a few days, but we wanted a more diverse offering between the US, Europe, and Asia, and so spent another week or so emailing more coworking spaces about the raffle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we got 40+ spaces on board, meaning we had enough partners to crown 3 different winners. We bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsumo.com/apps/giveaways/&quot;&gt;KingSumo plugin&lt;/a&gt; for running raffles on Wordpress, set up everything on a Dreamhost server, and then shipped it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/raffle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Raffle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were blown away by how much attention this got. We got massive amounts of social shares on Facebook and Twitter, and within the first 24 hours, we had over 1,000 people enter the raffle. The traffic actually kept on overloading our Dreamhost server, so we had to upgrade to a VPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the contest on May 3rd with over 10,000 people signed up. To put this in perspective, our mailing list before the raffle was somewhere around 800 subscribers. We also ended up tripling our Twitter followers and quadrupling our Page’s Facebook Likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was this so successful? We think it was a combination of a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we found an aspirational prize that resonated well with our target market: people who wanted to travel and work at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also probably helped that we had 40+ coworking spaces on board at launch, many of whom Tweeted about us or otherwise promoted the contest to their communities. This really helped plant the seeds of virality all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another large part of the success is probably due to the sharing mechanics of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsumo.com/apps/giveaways/&quot;&gt;KingSumo raffle plugin&lt;/a&gt;. It made things super easy: come up with an awesome prize, customize site content &amp;amp; a few emails, then sit back and watch the magic happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, one interesting finding was that we had significantly more referrals from Facebook than from Twitter during the raffle. One potential explanation for this is that when you shared our link on Facebook, it included a preview with an awesome map graphic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/facebook_coworking_share.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, it only included a simple link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/lessons-learned/twitter_coworking_share.png&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total raffle-related Facebook traffic: &lt;strong&gt;20,598&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total raffle-related Twitter traffic: &lt;strong&gt;675&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total number of raffle entrants as of 4/28: &lt;strong&gt;10,048&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned---raffle&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned - Raffle:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raffles can be super effective, even if you don’t already have a large mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come up with a remarkable prize, and then you can hit the ground running quickly with a turnkey solution like &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsumo.com/apps/giveaways/&quot;&gt;KingSumo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rafflecopter.com/&quot;&gt;Rafflecopter&lt;/a&gt;. If using a tool like KingSumo, make sure you set upload a picture to be included in Facebook shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you should think about the prize as another possible way to get distribution for the raffle. Try and find products from companies who will help you get the word out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried a bunch of things over the last 6 months, and found that a well-put-together raffle was the most effective channel for driving traffic, email signups, and applications. We’ll probably follow up with another raffle in another 3-6 months, and will also be putting some time into trying to hit the front page of Hacker News, as we’ve seen that can also be a high-ROI way to acquire users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area we haven’t experimented much with yet is word of mouth. While it’s hard to measure how effective marketing initiatives are on word of mouth, it’s already leading to a fair share of our applications, so encouraging more offline sharing could be a high-potential area for us going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a startup trying to figure out your own marketing strategy, hopefully the above can provide some food for thought and give you some direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have some feedback on the above? Have you tried something similar with a different result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to hear from you! &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:facilitators@hackerparadise.org&quot;&gt;Shoot us an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Under the Hood of Hacker Paradise</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/04/22/under-the-hood</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/04/22/under-the-hood</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have asked what happens behind the scenes at Hacker Paradise and what goes into running one of these trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why aren’t you more transparent?” they say. “Why aren’t you &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/&quot;&gt;more like Buffer&lt;/a&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency is a little scary, but we want to give it a try. We hope this post will help bring clarity to the work that goes into Hacker Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interviews&quot;&gt;Interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting people for Hacker Paradise may be the most important part of our job. People say that the community is the best part about Hacker Paradise, and one reason for this is that we spend a lot of time and effort to make sure that everyone who attends is smart, passionate, and open to meeting new people. For our Southeast Asia batch, we had over 180 applications, and we interviewed around 100 people. This is a significant time investment, as each interview takes 20-30 minutes, and some percentage of the people who schedule interviews flake or reschedule at the last minute. We’re experimenting with bringing on alumni to help scale this process up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scouting--choosing-locations&quot;&gt;Scouting / Choosing Locations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking places to go is both a fun and time-intensive task. For our Southeast Asia trip, I (Casey) flew out and visited each potential location and scouted hotels and coworking spaces in person. To give an idea of what the process has been like so far for Europe, we first narrowed our list of potential locations down to 5 cities, and then spent several weeks emailing with coworking spaces and hundreds of hotels, hostels, and apartments to see which cities were viable options for Hacker Paradise. This easily takes over 100 hours before the trip even begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizing-logistics--group-activities&quot;&gt;Organizing Logistics &amp;amp; Group Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes things like acquiring SIM cards, setting up our own routers in the hotels / coworking spaces we visit, finding places for group meals, putting together a curated guide to the city we’re in, planning a group trip, and organizing talks, workshops, hackdays, and demo nights. It also involves interfacing with the hotel when things go wrong &amp;amp; making sure everything at our workspace is up to par. When we’re on a trip, this typically takes someone 15-30 hours per week depending on what’s happening that week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;payments&quot;&gt;Payments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International finance is no fun. Modern day credit-card processing services like Stripe and Braintree are great, but are incompatible with credit cards from a number of European countries where a good number of our participants are based. Bitcoin is alright, but not everyone is comfortable paying with it yet. We’ve ultimately decided to use Paypal as our primary method of receiving payments, which is a bit scary, as they are known to freeze accounts without notice. Regardless, keeping track of payments from participants and then paying vendors is a complex process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also no fun to have to chase people for money. We’re in a weird position, in that we run the community, but we’re also part of it. What this means is that we become close with people, and then have to deal with repeatedly asking them for money or having to say no when they ask for discounts. Trying to do right by our friends while also trying to get the organization to a point where it is financially sustainable is one of the most emotionally taxing parts of running Hacker Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-the-experience&quot;&gt;Improving the Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend a lot of time thinking about and discussing how to make Hacker Paradise a better experience and how to make the community stronger. One example of something that has come out of this is the in-kind perks we’ve gotten from a number of sponsors, such as AWS, Heap Analytics, and Digital Ocean. Other things we’re working on are improving the on-boarding process for people who join part-way through a trip, experimenting with additional structure to help people be more productive, and creating explicit processes for how to deal with conflict within the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;process-automation&quot;&gt;Process Automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For awhile, Hacker Paradise ran on duct tape and Zapier. As we’ve grown larger, it’s become more and more difficult to make sure that we are on top of interviews, arrivals, hotel reservations, and the interfaces between all of our internal systems (IE, Google Spreadsheets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a sustainable business, we need to move to a more robust solution, so we’re working on building some internal software, which can help manage the application and reservation processes. There are a number of other internal processes (scouting, on-boarding, etc.) that also need to be improved if Hacker Paradise is going to survive long-term, and we’ll be spending a lot of time on those in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring--training&quot;&gt;Hiring &amp;amp; Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Hacker Paradise is a team of 3 that travels with the group, handles operations, plans future trips, and works to grow the organization. Running the group is exhausting, and it’s critical that we bring on several quality people over the next 3-6 months and train them to the point where they can run trips on their own while we focus on building the business and supporting them remotely. We’re just beginning this process - if you’re interested or know someone who might be a good fit, shoot us an email!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marketing--promotion&quot;&gt;Marketing / Promotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we need to get the word out about Hacker Paradise to continue to attract such awesome people. One way we approach this is through keeping an active social media presence. We’ve also recently gotten some press (TechCrunch &amp;amp; The Guardian), and (all-too-infrequently) write blog posts which we then submit to Hacker News and other tech sites, and have experimented with a few things on Product Hunt. The most successful thing we’ve done so far is our “Win a Free Year of Coworking Around the World” raffle - it was a smashing success, and we’ll be writing a post with more details about that in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a few other things we do, like deal with email / Slack support and have late-night discussions about where to take Hacker Paradise and how to make it more sustainable. However, the above should give you a good idea of what it takes to put a trip together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in running your own workaway retreat, feel free to reach out - we’re happy to talk in more detail about the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking to travel the world with some awesome people this summer while working remotely or on your own personal projects, we’re currently taking applications for our summer batch in Europe (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;apply on our homepage&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why You Should Move Your Social Venture to Cebu City, Philippines </title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/01/13/cebu-city</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2015/01/13/cebu-city</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1400/1*8FhbfV8mwuiv5HLA07yC2g.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;cebu-skyline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ravi Agarwal is no stranger to the startup game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started his first Internet company in Boston in 1997, and has since had several successful exits, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seekingalpha.com/article/1772742-ipo-preview-endurance-international-group-holdings&quot;&gt;including an IPO&lt;/a&gt;. After a few years in San Francisco, he wanted more meaning in his life, and took off on an extended trip throughout Africa and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he landed in Cebu, a coastal city in the Philippines. This is where Ravi has decided to build &lt;a href=&quot;http://engagespark.com/&quot;&gt;EngageSpark&lt;/a&gt;, a company focused on poverty alleviation in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, he walked me through the decision and told me about why he and his partner think Cebu could become the world’s leading hub for social enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-tell-me-a-little-about-your-business&quot;&gt;First, tell me a little about your business.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build software that helps governments and NGOs set up SMS and phone campaigns really easily. Last year, we tested our product in the market with an NGO called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercycorps.org/&quot;&gt;Mercy Corp&lt;/a&gt;. We sent out educational material on financial literacy to 25,000 people here in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-did-you-pick-cebu&quot;&gt;Why did you pick Cebu?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good engineer, I created a weighted spreadsheet to evaluate different places to start a social business. It ultimately came down to 6 cities in Indonesia and 3 in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 criteria I had were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The country needed to have a high density of poverty (meaning concentrated in cities, not spread out in rural areas).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There needed to be good infrastructure — roads, hospitals, electricity, Internet, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There had to be an available talent pool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It had to be a good place to live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Africa, poverty is spread out and hard to reach. On the other hand, the Philippines has a population of 100 million people, and out of that, maybe 60 to 70 million live in poverty, or at least are lacking opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia was also a good fit, but only 20–30% of developers there speak English sufficiently well. Since Indonesia is so big, there are a lot of multinational firms there, so salaries are crazy. In the Philippines, everyone speaks English, so hiring is easy, and it’s easy to get around the country outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at those 4 criteria, Cebu was the clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-else-did-you-look&quot;&gt;Where else did you look?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, we were also looking at Manila and Davao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manila has too much pollution and crime. Every time you get in a taxi, you have to haggle on the price. These are small things, but over time, they add up emotionally. I also love the outdoors, and in Manila, you have to drive for several hours to find good outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cebu, you can start hiking in 20 minutes, can be diving in the water in less than an hour, can be kayaking / stand-up paddling in 40 minutes. Rock climbing is also just a few hours away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davao was actually pretty great — I loved it. It’s less crowded, safer, and more intimate. They have this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/the-philippines-reallife-punisher-davao-city-mayor-rodrigo-duterte-urged-to-run-for-president/story-fnh81fz8-1226973937374&quot;&gt;“Punisher Mayor”&lt;/a&gt; who is really tough on crime, so you can leave your laptop visibly out in your car while it’s parked — you wouldn’t do that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Davao just doesn’t have the necessary talent pool. Most people leave Davao to go to Cebu or Manila. It’s still a small city with fewer jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-has-your-experience-been-like-in-cebu-over-the-past-year&quot;&gt;What has your experience been like in Cebu over the past year?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing people here is different. One big thing we were advised about early on is not to criticize people publicly. If you make people lose face, they’ll quit. Critical feedback should be done in private. But you should praise in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole though, it’s been good. There is a sizeable expat community here, and we’ve connected with them and other startups to help us have a soft landing. They referred us to lawyers, gave us advice, etc. Through those connections and advice, we were able to incorporate here for less than $1000 for everything — licenses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-has-hiring-been-like&quot;&gt;What has hiring been like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring junior talent is easy. Labor rates here are low — you can find a fresh CS grad for $300–400 per month. Hiring people with 4–5 years of experience is also doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a brain drain here though — talented developers often leave Cebu after 5–7 years of experience and get a job outside of the Philippines or in Manila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for this is that there is a culture in the Philippines of paying for your family members’ education. This is why out of a population of 100 million people, 10 million work abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech community here is also quite young, less developed than in Manila. That’s one of the reasons we started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetidecebu.com/&quot;&gt;The Tide&lt;/a&gt;, our coworking space. We wanted to create a meeting space for the tech community to help it grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, with all the above, our burn rate is probably 20x less than it would be in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-your-quality-of-life-like-in-cebu&quot;&gt;What is your quality of life like in Cebu?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cebu is a nice city. It has all the modern amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lived in remote places, like Africa, but after a year or two, it’s nice to be able to go to a nice restaurant or to have access to a mall — I mean the mall here even sells the same Sonicare electric toothbrush I got in the States. Even though you’re in the developing world, you don’t feel like you’re living a rough life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, you can also create your ideal lifestyle here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care about my health, so I have a full time helper who comes to my place to clean, cook, run errands, pay bills, etc. I gave her some guidelines in the beginning and taught her about some foreign foods, like quinoa, but after that, she’s taken complete charge of planning and cooking healthy meals. She even learned how to make hummus. This costs a couple hundred dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a yoga instructor come to my place three times a week for a private yoga class. Here, this costs $10 — less than the cost of a group class in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other nice thing about Cebu is the easy access to beach resorts. You can get a day pass for $25 dollars, which includes a buffet meal, and then spend the day sitting at the beach, jumping in the water, snorkeling, and doing some work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-cost-of-living-like&quot;&gt;What is the cost of living like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bring in &lt;a href=&quot;http://engagespark.com/files/jd-fellows-tech1.pdf&quot;&gt;fellows from the US and Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and we tell them that you can live well here for $10–15 per day (excluding housing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food here is very cheap. Western-oriented restaurants are $4–5 per meal, and local style restaurants are only $1–2 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around the city, Jeepneys cost about $0.20 and taxis cost $1.50 for most places within the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1057/1*83jD2_tHlcQKNE2eeR4ffg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;jeepney&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Jeepney in CebuBeer is $1. And that’s at a bar. If you buy it at the grocery store, it’s like $0.60. So much cheaper than back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-there-to-do-in-cebu-outside-of-work&quot;&gt;What is there to do in Cebu outside of work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Cebu is the outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving here is awesome. You’ll see a ton of fish. I’ve seen a big school of barracuda, millions of sardines, like walls of sardines, and tons of other fish. There’s even a little airplane that’s sunk that you can dive through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.divernet.com/siteimage/scale/800/600/309911.png&quot; alt=&quot;moalboal-wreck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snorkeling is good too. You can also rent kayaks or do other water sports like jet skiing, parasailing, wakeboarding, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also mountains that are 20 minutes away. I’ve been exploring a number of the trails and have hiked up to this great waterfall. There aren’t marked trails, just paths used by the people who live there. You can’t really get lost, because people live in the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trail running and yoga are also getting big. There are over 100,000 business process and tech workers here in Cebu. They’re all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketing-interactive.com/5-things-filipino-emerging-middle-class-consumer/&quot;&gt;newly-minted middle-class young people&lt;/a&gt;. They want to explore middle class hobbies, so they’re getting into running, mountain biking, yoga, diving, etc. All these things are getting big because they have all this disposable income — their parents wouldn’t even know what yoga meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-next-for-engagespark&quot;&gt;What’s next for EngageSpark?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just finishing up our platform for a wider beta release, and will start marketing it in January. Thus, we’ll start hiring more people on the marketing and customer service side, as well as continue to build out our development team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be expanding our &lt;a href=&quot;http://engagespark.com/files/jd-fellows-tech1.pdf&quot;&gt;Fellowship program&lt;/a&gt;, where we bring talented developers over from the US or Europe to work with our team and experience what it’s like to live and work in a developing nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-you-tell-someone-whos-thinking-about-moving-to-cebu&quot;&gt;What would you tell someone who’s thinking about moving to Cebu?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got this huge density of poverty, good infrastructure, and a good talent pool, so it’s a great place to build products, test them out, and then scale them to other countries at a low cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an ideal spot. There’s no reason why Cebu can’t become the hub for social enterprise in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to check out Cebu or some other awesome spots in Southeast Asia? Join us for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;Hacker Paradise’s trip through Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, and the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, starting February 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This is How We Get Ants</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2014/12/07/how-we-get-ants</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2014/12/07/how-we-get-ants</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width: 100%; height: auto; padding-left: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*45pF-v6BEjAiLFnG3lVtNw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been just over two weeks since &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;Hacker Paradise&lt;/a&gt; (our programming retreat in Costa Rica) came to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants came from over 10 different countries and had a ton of fun while working on some really cool projects, ranging from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://raveomat.com/&quot;&gt;Django-powered site for finding electronic music events in Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlieguo.com/unscalable&quot;&gt;book on how to scale your startup&lt;/a&gt;. Even cooler, several people decided to quit their jobs, and several more made the decision to go fully nomadic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are a number of areas in which we’d like to improve. Here are some lessons we learned along the way and things we’ll do differently next time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-expectations&quot;&gt;Setting Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our host for the retreat, we partnered with a small, boutique hotel set in the jungle of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Being set in the jungle, the weather was often hot and humid, and there were lots of ants and other little critters crawling around. Some people were unprepared for this, so we want to be more explicit in the future about what to expect to give participants a clearer idea of what it will be like to live abroad in an unfamiliar location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-and-drawbacks-of-isolation&quot;&gt;Benefits and Drawbacks of Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the jungle offered a serene and remote location, it also meant that we more isolated than people expected – the nearest town was ~20 minutes away, and even that was quite small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A benefit of this was that the community formed quickly and became quite close. This may have been because the only people you really interacted with on a regular basis were the other participants. People got pretty stir-crazy towards the end, which was helped a bit by branching out and befriending some people who were attending a local language school.&lt;/p&gtgt;

&lt;p&gt;To deal with this for our next retreat, we are looking at locations in major cities and other lively areas, and we will be moving groups to a new country each month to keep things fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-good-internet&quot;&gt;The Importance of Good Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that having consistently good Internet connection would be important for the retreat, and to prepare, we brought in four separate lines – two cable lines at 3 Mbps and two DSL lines at 6 Mbps. Within the first week, however, it became clear that while the bandwidth might be sufficient, the routing equipment at the hotel could not handle the necessary number of simultaneous connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a few of our participants had experience in network administration, and we were able to borrow commercial routing equipment that someone had brought down. However, we still had issues with the DSL company and the hotel network infrastructure throughout much of the retreat, so Internet in the rooms continued to be spotty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main takeaway here is that we need to do more to ensure our participants have good and consistent Internet throughout the retreat. Next time, we’re planning to work with local co-working spaces and to buy everyone data SIM cards. We think this will work well, but another option we may try is to bring our own networking equipment and take full ownership over the wireless infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scouting-locations&quot;&gt;Scouting Locations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can learn a lot about a hotel from online resources, there’s no real substitute for actually visiting a potential host. In Costa Rica, we had an existing relationship with our partner hotel, so even though we chose them before landing on the ground, we were confident that things would work out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we’ve heard enough horror stories that we’ll be vetting all potential venues in-person in the future before cutting a deal. In addition to checking out the cleanliness, comfort, and amenities of potential hotels, part of that process will also be to stress-test the wireless networks and to make sure there are interesting activities nearby (restaurants, beaches, nightlife, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;separation-of-work-and-living-space&quot;&gt;Separation of Work and Living Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our workspace for the retreat was also the hotel restaurant. On the one hand, this was convenient - you could order lunch while working and then dive back into your projects after your meal. However, it also blurred the lines between work and play, which may have contributed to feelings of overwork and burnout at times. In the future, we want to make sure we have a clear delineation between work spaces and living / play spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;momentum&quot;&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People started to lose momentum partway through the retreat. One thing that we think contributed to this is the lack of separation between work and living spaces. It was easy for people to work at night or on weekends, and that may have led to fatigue over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing we think contributed to the decline in momentum is that people began taking trips to other parts of Costa Rica and returning mid-week. When people were gone for the whole week, everything went smoothly, and they were able to jump right back into the work environment when they returned. However, when people took trips that returned mid-week, it seemed to mess up the flow for everyone. The people who were gone found it hard to get back into work mid-week, and so often ended up just chilling. This created a weird vibe for the people who had stayed and were working like normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, while we’re still going to encourage people to travel and see the countries we’re visiting, we’re going to require them to be there on Monday mornings to start the week off strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our structure in the beginning consisted solely of daily stand-ups and weekly demos, and most people told us that this was less than they had expected. After people settled in, this seemed to be both a positive and a negative. People enjoyed the freedom to do whatever they wanted and to pursue their own projects and goals. At the same time, some participants felt like they might have been more productive if they’d had more structure and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing this, we made a few changes during the retreat – namely, we added a weekly goal-setting breakfast at the beginning of the week and organized more talks and seminars for weekends. We also implemented an “everybody demos” culture that got more people to showcase their work to the group. We’re going to continue to experiment with this in the future to find ways to bring additional accountability to those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-service-providers&quot;&gt;Local Service Providers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had several issues arise in deals that were made with a local masseuse and a local surf instructor. Shortly after our participants committed to a deal, the locals tried to charge them more money. This could have been due to a miscommunication, but from the circumstances, it seems more likely that they needed money and thought they could get more out of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the vendors came through a recommendation, but we were not directly involved in the deals made with our participants. In the future, we will be handling local vendor relationships directly and making sure terms are explicitly agreed to before entering any arrangement. This gives us some leverage to protect participants in the event that things go haywire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things we learned this retreat is the importance of community. Even though there were a number of bumps in the road and areas for improvement, the community was so strong and supportive that participants still had an overwhelmingly positive experience. It seems cliché, but more than a couple of people have reached out to us since returning home to tell us that the experience was life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, our main takeaways are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick great people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find or set up good Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cultivate a strong community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about organizing something similar, feel free to reach out to us and we’ll be happy to talk more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you’re interested in traveling with us, we’ve just opened applications for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;our spring batch in Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Launching a Mac app in 32 languages for less than $250</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2014/11/04/how-current-launched-with-32-languages</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2014/11/04/how-current-launched-with-32-languages</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February, &lt;a href=&quot;http://appden.com&quot;&gt;Scott Kyle&lt;/a&gt; quit his full-time job as Head of Engineering at a startup and went indie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cruzio.com/services/coworking/&quot;&gt;Cruzio in Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, Scott began to build &lt;a href=&quot;http://currentformac.com&quot;&gt;Current&lt;/a&gt;, the Facebook client for Mac that launched this week to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cultofmac.com/301755/current-for-mac/&quot;&gt;rave reviews&lt;/a&gt;, climbing to the top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/posts/current&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; and becoming the #1 top-selling app in Social Networking on the Mac App store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott is visiting Hacker Paradise this week to teach a workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, the JS UI library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alexey-so-how-does-current-work-exactly&quot;&gt;[Alexey] So how does Current work, exactly?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Scott&lt;/strong&gt;] The app uses Facebook’s JavaScript directly to render parts of the page into different web views—messaging, news feed, etc. I learned a lot about decompiling Facebook’s Javascript and their React implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has been porting most of their components into React over the past year. They’re doing it iteratively. Every time they make a change, I can tell, because the code keeps getting cleaner. It’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-launched-with-support-for-32-languages&quot;&gt;Current launched with support for 32 languages.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…yeah, that wasn’t as hard as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, since most of the elements are coming from Facebook, they are already translated—so I don’t have to do those parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the translations that were left were preference and menu options: “Notification Center,” “Open New Window,” etc. I found out that Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=localization&quot;&gt;actually provides a lot of common strings&lt;/a&gt; (developer account required) in each of the 32 languages that OS X is translated into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I incorporated their translations, there were around 40 words left [to translate] per language. I got a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tethras.com/&quot;&gt;Tethras&lt;/a&gt; for about $7 per language to get the remaining translations done. So I just got all of them.  The whole thing cost like, $220.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/current-localizations-256.png&quot; alt=&quot;Effort chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;was-it-worth-it&quot;&gt;Was it worth it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily. About half of sales so far have been from outside the US, and about a quarter are in a language other than English. That’s a third more sales for maybe a week of work, altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/scott-pie.png&quot; alt=&quot;Effort chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a week after launch, Current is still the number one selling Social Networking app in 18 countries. Brazil, Germany, India, Poland, Czech Republic, Israel, Malaysia. I don’t know how many of these we would have gotten without localizing the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hows-life-as-an-indie-dev&quot;&gt;How’s life as an indie dev?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More stressful than anything I’ve ever done. Pretty sure I’m working harder than ever before. I’m responsible for everything—all the bugs, all the support, all the marketing. It’s just a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-do-you-feel-about-articles-like-this-onehttpbloghelftonecommac-app-store-the-subtle-exodus-that-talk-about-the-decline-of-the-mac-app-store&quot;&gt;How do you feel about articles like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.helftone.com/mac-app-store-the-subtle-exodus/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; that talk about the decline of the Mac App Store?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’ve read that. I mostly agree with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think [the Mac App Store] is dying. I feel like the market is still growing. But I think it could be growing faster if Apple iterated more on the Mac App Store experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hows-hacker-paradise&quot;&gt;How’s Hacker Paradise?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t actually write, “it’s alright.” That was a joke!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…now you’re just fucking with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;im-going-to-publish-this-verbatim&quot;&gt;I’m going to publish this verbatim.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure! I actually really like it. Everyone seems to have a great work ethic and be very interesting. I especially like being around people from many different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/current-for-facebook/id923920635?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=12&quot;&gt;for sale now&lt;/a&gt; at $1.99. Buy it now in the language of your choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Hackday in Paradise</title>
      <link>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2014/10/02/hackday-in-paradise</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author></author>
      <guid>http://hackerparadise.org/blog/2014/10/02/hackday-in-paradise</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-bio sidebar-bio-left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/participants/wei.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wei is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thiswei.com/&quot;&gt;designer, illustrator, and creator of things&lt;/a&gt;. When she’s not at Hacker Paradise, she’s earning a living as a freelance UX designer and traveling the USA in her VW bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do we need judges?” asks Wei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Winners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why do we need winners?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” I sigh. “No judges.” The group cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the second Saturday of our twelve week hacker retreat on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.  Most of the twenty participants have been using the time to work on their start-ups, as remote developers, or on becoming better developers. As organizers, we want to see more collaboration. Thus the hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-bio sidebar-bio-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/participants/jorge.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jorge is a sysadmin at Hewlett Packard who taught himself how to code using OpenCourseware. At Hacker Paradise, he is leveling up his Python/Flask development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve scheduled “hacking” to start after breakfast at 10AM, but so far only a few attendees have laptops out - &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.co.cr/running-on-tico-time-in-costa-rica/26869/&quot;&gt;Tico Time&lt;/a&gt; in full effect. My hackmate Jorge and I get started. We’re building &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AlexeyMK/bedspread&quot;&gt;bedspread&lt;/a&gt;, a room booking system for the retreat on top of Google Spreadsheets.  We spend the first thirty minutes at the drawing board and the next thirty getting the HDMI cable to connect properly with the external monitor we’ve borrowed.  Somewhere halfway through this, my Mac restarts. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As hackers slowly trickle into the hackspace, we try to figure out whether to delay demos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey! Would you rather demo before dinner, or tomorrow morning?”  Hackers prefer before dinner.
“I don’t know if that’ll be long enough,” says Casey, the other facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-bio sidebar-bio-left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/participants/matt.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When he’s not leading surfing trips to the beach, Matt works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cropster.com&quot;&gt;Cropster&lt;/a&gt;, a tech company that helps coffee and cocoa farmers improve crop yields and consistency. &lt;br /&gt;“Whenever I’m on a call and there are birds in the background, I have to stop an explain where I am. Then it’s like, no, I’m not on vacation. Well, sort of…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’chall building?” Matt stops by. Jorge and I are not the only ones stuck in setup hell. Matt and Rob are creating a chat bot for surfing forecasts, and it turns out none of the good forecast providers have APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’da think they would,” says Matt, “but they’re all hogging it to themselves. Intellectual property, or something.” Matt and Rob consider resorting to a scraper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shoo Matt away and get back to work. An hour later, we have text on the browser emanating from a spreadsheet  out of a Google Doc.  High-five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You guys want some ceviche?”  Casey’s spent the morning in a nearby town acquiring hackathon snacks. Jorge and I take a five-minute break and dig in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/ceviche.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ceviche&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I borrow Casey for a minute for an early demo. “As the client, what other features would you want this to have?”  It turns out our calendar is not very intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend the next few hours on UI polish and finish with time to spare before demos.  I go bother Wei about judging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob and Matt are cutting it close.  As Rob explains,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-bio sidebar-bio-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/participants/rob.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A former professional poker player, &lt;a href=&quot;http://robcole.github.io&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deucescracked.com/&quot;&gt;DeucesCracked&lt;/a&gt;, an online poker training site. At HackerParadise, Rob is improving his Ruby/Rails from ‘usable’ to ‘solid’ through side projects for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattleallegro.com/history/&quot;&gt;coffee shop he co-owns with his wife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was obsessively shipping commits left and right to fix small bugs. Things were working but not in the way we intended. Heroku time zones fixes were a nightmare to fix… basically, because javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Matt was in “let’s just make sure we have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; we can demo” mode. Every time I fixed a bug, two showed up in it’s place — like some sort of hydra.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We pushed the last fix out at 5:59 with seconds to spare.
Then we realized no one else was ready to go and we patched up the remainder of the bugs in a much less harried way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once demos finally get under way around 6:45, Rob and Matt’s demo goes off without a hitch, and Jorge walks he audience through how we build bedspread.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/matt_pointing_to_screen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matt pointing to screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, more than half of the attendees have something to show and everybody turns out to see what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wei, the judge that wouldn’t, approves. “I didn’t participate this time, but I thought the atmosphere was great” she says. “I’ll be at the next one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/audience_watches_demo_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matt pointing to screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casey leans over.  “What about the hammocks?” he asks. We had purchased hammocks to give to the winning hackers. No judges, though, so no winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Meh,” I say.  “We’ll figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>47% of initial applications for our Hacker Retreat came from women. This is how we did it.</title>

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you’ve been in technology for any amount of time, you’ll have noticed that there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/17/technology/diversity-silicon-valley/index.html&quot;&gt;slight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/02/14/dropboxs-hiring-practices-explain-its-disappointing%E2%80%8B-lack-of-female-employees/&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/triketora/women-in-software-eng&quot;&gt;imbalance&lt;/a&gt;. As we laid the groundwork for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;Hacker Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to ensure that retreat participants were more diverse than the usual suspects, caucasian males in their twenties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We approached the problem head on — as a result, 14 out of 30 the applications from our initial outreach came from women. Here are some lessons we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-upfamiliarize-yourself-with-the-best-practices&quot;&gt;1. Read up — familiarize yourself with the best practices.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the process, we came across several articles and blog posts that helped direct our actions. HBR has a great piece on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/01/theres-no-excuse-for-all-white-male-panels/&quot;&gt;organizing conferences that aren’t dominated by white male speakers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki&quot;&gt;Geek Feminism Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is also a great place to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Promotion_to_women&quot;&gt;appropriate ways to promote to women&lt;/a&gt; and to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Resources_for_conference_organizers&quot;&gt;resources for creating welcoming communities&lt;/a&gt;. Ginny Skalski of Red Hat also has a great post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.com/life/13/11/how-attract-more-women-tech-conferences&quot;&gt;attracting women to conferences&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a couple good Quora posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Women-in-Technology-1/Why-dont-more-women-go-to-hackathons&quot;&gt;why women don’t go to hackathons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Women-in-Technology-1/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-woman-working-in-the-tech-industry&quot;&gt;what it’s like to be a woman in tech&lt;/a&gt; that we would highly recommend reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ask-for-feedback-from-women-in-tech&quot;&gt;2. Ask for feedback from women in tech.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After building our initial landing page, we reached out to several women-in-tech community organizers who helped steer us in the right direction. In particular, the organizers of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewc.co/&quot;&gt;Women’s Coding Collective&lt;/a&gt; proved invaluable in pointing out several things that could make it difficult for some women to see themselves as participants in our retreat, which we discuss in the next two points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-the-site-copyhttpwwwhackerparadiseorg-welcoming-and-balanced&quot;&gt;3. Make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;site copy&lt;/a&gt; welcoming and balanced.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning our copy emphasized an open community and a collaborative learning environment. We chose to avoid industry buzzwords, like “ninja” &amp;amp; “rockstar,” and explicitly discussed pair programming &amp;amp; peer-learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, in our first draft, most of the quotes on our page were from prominent male thinkers, and our only picture featuring people was of 4 guys playing foosball:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1286/1*mZRCbvTpMtCdPwU5JUQNMQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Foosball&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They advised us to consider what kind of image this portrayed, and to whom it would be attractive. After considering this, we decided to add some much-needed gender balance to the photos on our page, and added one of our favorite Helen Keller quotes to the site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1366/1*CEeo9URzdIuJGhvR1v_ztg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Helen Keller&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1366/1*ve9hvDIcPiLvRzXchuce6A.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reading on the Beach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adopt-a-code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;4. Adopt a code of conduct.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents&quot;&gt;long history of sexism at technology events&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, codes of conduct are becoming mainstream at tech conferences as a way to set standards of acceptable behavior. On the advice of several people, we created our own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/conduct.html&quot;&gt;anti-harassment code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;, modeled after the sample policy on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy&quot;&gt;Geek Feminism Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. We had been looking for a way to clearly set the tone that our community would be tolerant and supportive; a code of conduct felt like a great start in making the retreat a safe space for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-it-a-priority-to-reach-out-to-organizations-that-support-women-in-tech&quot;&gt;5. Make it a priority to reach out to organizations that support women in tech.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of organizations that help support female programmers, designers, and entrepreneurs. Many of these groups are happy to send interesting events and opportunities to their members, and without their support, our initial applications would have likely been much more male-skewed. Particularly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwhocode.com/&quot;&gt;Women Who Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://girlgeekdinners.com/&quot;&gt;Girl Geek Dinners&lt;/a&gt;, and several chapters of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girldevelopit.com/&quot;&gt;Girl Develop It&lt;/a&gt; were extremely helpful in passing our information along to their members. We were also lucky enough to connect with WICS groups from schools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.columbia.edu/wics/&quot;&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wecs.csc.uvic.ca/&quot;&gt;University of Victoria&lt;/a&gt; who were willing to spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing-gender-imbalance-is-a-marathon-not-a-sprint&quot;&gt;Fixing gender imbalance is a marathon, not a sprint.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching more women isn’t just a noble cause — we believe that having a diverse community will spark more ideas and creativity, and will also create a more tolerant community for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that gender imbalance in tech is a result of the gender imbalance in STEM overall, and that girls drop out of the tech pipeline as early as middle school. That’s no excuse, though — there are things that each of us can do today to help address the problem. Consider getting involved in mentorship with local groups, helping teach classes, or simply speaking out when issues of sexism do arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have started to explore a couple of these options for our Costa Rica retreat in September, and look forward to putting them into action for future batches. We particularly admire what &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerschool.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker School&lt;/a&gt; has done with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/hacker-grants&quot;&gt;Etsy Hacker Grants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ps&quot;&gt;PS.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re creating a jobs page for your company or planning an event, we hope our experience can be useful. And, if you find yourself in the mood for a sojourn to Costa Rica this fall, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerparadise.org/&quot;&gt;couple of spots&lt;/a&gt; are still available.&lt;/p&gt;
